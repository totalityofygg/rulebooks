 \mybold{If your Flesh ever goes to 0 or below, you are Dying}.  


Your Grit immediately drops to 0 (if it isn't 0 already), and your Flesh is set to 0. Grit can't be healed if you're Dying, only Flesh.

  While at 0 Flesh you can't do anything but crawl to safety and hold your intestines in. If you do \myital{anything} more strenuous than this, make a \DEATH try. \mybold{If you roll a Failure, you immediately perish}. Continue trying your \DEATH at the top of every Moment you continue to do anything more than lie there. 

  If you continue to take damage (you're \mylink{Bleeding}{effect-bleeding}, someone continues to beat on you as you crawl to safety, etc.) you must make a \DEATH try for \myital{each} point of damage you take i.e. if you're Dying and you take 5 damage, you must succeed on 5 \DEATH tries.  Good luck!

  Unless noted in their Trope or Species, all Adventurers' \DEATH starts at Precarious (d3).  Additional levels of \DEATH can be learned during \mylink{Advancement}{advancement}.

  The moment you are healed above 0 Flesh (through Resting, Leechcraft, etc) you are no longer Dying, but you must \myital{immediately}: 

\callout {
 \mybullet {
    \item Roll your \INSANITY (and apply its result), and
    \item Roll your \INJURY (and apply its result).
 }
}

If your Adventurer should die, their Mortal soul journeys to \mylink{Limbo}{the-afterlife}, where it resides for seven days before departing. If your Adventurer does not have a soul when they perish - if they are Unseelie, or afflicted in some way - they immediately wink out of existence as if they never were.  See the section on \mylink{the Afterlife}{the-afterlife} (and \mylink{Katabasis}{occultism-katabasis}) for more info.
