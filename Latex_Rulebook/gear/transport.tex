\mysection{Transport}{gear-transport}

   
  \mybold{Mule}: basic beast of burden, doesn't panic easily.  Can carry 25 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} (about 100kg).

  \mybold{Horse}:   good for riding, tends to bolt when scared.  Can carry 50 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} (about 200kg).

  \mybold{Camel}:  never runs, generally an asshole, only found in desert terrain.  Can carry 75 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} (about 300kg).

  \mybold{Push cart}:  push around all your stuff, takes 2 hands to use.  Can carry 25 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} (about 100kg).

  \mybold{Wagon}:  can't go anywhere on its own.  Depending on the size, can carry 25 - 100 Burden (100kg - 400kg) worth of gear and people (roll a d4 to see how big the one available might be).  The wagon needs an appropriate number of mounts to pull it (25 Burden/100kg can be pulled by 1 mule, 50 Burden / 200kg can be pulled by 2 mules or a horse, etc.).

  \mybold{Rowboat}:  only available near civilizations with water.  Same weight rules as Wagons (25 - 100 Burden worth of gear and people).

    \myhighlight{Mounts}{gear-mounts}
    
    Mounts must pass a \mylink{Morale}{monster-morale} try to enter dangerous situations (combat, entering a dungeon, jumping a chasm, etc). Random mounts have \mylink{Cowardly morale}{monster-morale}; trained mounts (warhorses, etc.) have \mylink{Orderly morale}{monster-morale}.  If the morale check fails the mount will take no action (though if you want to flee on your mount, that's allowed). If your mount fails a Morale check, you can try \mylink{Skill: Travel}{skill-travel}; if you succeed, the mount gets another morale check. See the section on \mylink{Morale}{monster-morale} under the \mylink{Monsters}{monsters} section.

    You can \mylink{Bum Rush}{combat-deeds-bum-rush} while mounted; if you successfully hit, deal +4 damage.  If you or your mount take damage while mounted, you can you can try \mylink{Skill: Travel}{skill-travel}; if you succeed, you decide who takes the damage (you or the mount).
