\begin{multicols}{2}


  \mybold{25m of rope} Holds 1 person and their gear safely (about 100kg). The rope will break if it is put under heavier loads, impacts, or shearing (such as sawing it back and forth along a jagged edge).
  
  \mybold{Bandolier} You can carry 4 Daggers on a bandolier and it only counts as 1 Burden. You can't wear more than 2 bandoliers.
  
  \mybold{Bell, Miniature} Small twinkly iron bell, useful for attaching to cats or summoning dinner.

  \mybold{Black Powder} Necessary for the firing of \mylink{Pistols and Muskets}{gear-foc-weapons}. Creates a flash of flame if lit on fire.  

  \mybold{Blowpipe} Useful for blowing powders into people's noses.  Mystics and Knaves are fans (so are Pooka, but for different reasons).
  
  \mybold{Book Hanger}  Hangs from the belt for easy access.  No need to dig a Grimoire out of a pack!

  \mybold{Caltrops, Handful}  Toss behind you to slow down pursuit. If you're using the rules for \mylink{getting chased}{arbiter-movement-die}, move your die \DCUP.

  \mybold{Candles} Enough illumination to read by, or examine weird hieroglyphics - but not much else.

  \mybold{Chain, 3m} Wrap around your torso for that metal look.

  \mybold{Chalk} Like school back in the day, maybe you want to play hopscotch.

  \mybold{Chisel} Useful for prying up stones or gems out of idol's eyes.

  \mybold{Crowbar} Turns most doors from a question to "can we open this door?" to "how long will it take us to open this door?"
  
  \mybold{Flask of Liquor} Just a bunch of booze. Good for rousing people and making friends. Drink during a \mylink{Breather}{combat-resting-breather} to restore Grit. See the section on \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} for more info. You can throw a Flask of Liquor as an \mylink{\INT weapon}{gear-int-weapons} (see the section on \mylink{Weapons}{gear-weapons} for more info). If thrown, needs something to light it on fire.

  \mybold{Flask of Oil} In a lantern, burns for about 4 hours. On the ground, can create a pool about 1m in diameter or a line 3 meters in length. You can throw a Flask of Oil as an \mylink{\INT weapon}{gear-int-weapons} (see the section on \mylink{Weapons}{gear-weapons} for more info). Needs something to light it on fire.


  \mybold{Grappling Hook} A necessity for those hard to reach places.
  
  \mybold{Grimoire (empty)} Holds 10 spells. Built to resist water and fire. See the section on \mylink{Grimoires}{grimoires} for more info.


  \mybold{Hand Mirror, Copper} Good for seeing around corners and adjusting your face paint, but if you want to use a mirror to petrify a medusa,  you'll need something of higher quality.

  \mybold{Handsaw}  Useful for cutting tree limbs and ... other limbs.

  \mybold{Ink, Bottle}  Leave a semi-permanent mark.

  \mybold{Lantern} Holds oil and burns it so you can see.
  
  \mybold{Leather Work Gloves} Allows Spriggan to touch iron without injuring themselves, but doesn't allow someone to hold a sword and invoke a \mylink{Secret}{arcana-wizardry-secrets}.
  
  \mybold{Matches} We can't all be super cool wizards who light their pipes with a snap of the fingers.  Provides a few Moments of light.
  
  \mybold{Manacles} For handcuffing people.  Reasons vary.

  \mybold{Marbles, Bag} Throw on ground to create new problems.

  \mybold{Musical Instrument} The number of hands and whether or not it counts as 1 Burden are up to the Arbiter. 

  \mybold{Pick, Climbing} You can't hurt anyone with this in Combat (torturing someone is another story). Gives you a bonus when climbing at the Arbiter's discretion.
  
  \mybold{Pipe} Useful for smoking things. Base cost gets you a crappy corncob pipe - sweet wizard's pipes are more expensive.  Philosophers, Mystics, and (surprise!) Pooka are fans.
  
  \mybold{Provisions - Personal} The "iron rations" of the old days.  Food and water for one person.

\myimage{gear/GearGeneric}


  \mybold{Provisions - Journey} Enough food and water to feed 5-7 people and 1 mount for 1 Leg of a Journey (5-10 Days).  Has a Burden of 25 (about 100kg).
  
  \mybold{Quiver} Filled with arrows/bolts.  Strongbows, Bows, and Crossbows are useless without them.


  \mybold{Shovel} Camp-style shovel for digging latrines. Or graves.

  
\cbreak


  \mybold{Shot} Tiny balls of iron. Necessary for the firing of Pistols and Muskets.     

  \mybold{Spikes and Hammer} Good for spiking doors shut, or crucifixions.  Hammer can't hurt anyone unless it's driving the spike into an eye or something.

  \mybold{Syringe} Jab \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} or sera into someone.  Philosophers and Pooka are fans.
  
  \mybold{Three Meter Pole} The old standby. Juuuuuust shy of 10 feet.

  \mybold{Torches and Tinderbox} Lasts for a few hours.  Tinderbox included with set.
