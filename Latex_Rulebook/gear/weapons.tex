  \mysubsection{Weapon Attributes}{gear-weapon-attributes}

  In addition to the Trait required to use a weapon, certain weapons have additional Attributes because of their size, weight, or method of use. Most of these Attributes are optional (see the Crunch section below), but pay special attention to weapons with the \mybold{Splattering} Attribute - normally thrown and explosive \INT weapons.

\callout {

\mybold{\myanchor{Cleaving}{weapon-attribute-cleaving}}

If the attack kills a Monster, you may immediately attack again.

\myskip

\mybold{\myanchor{Dazing}{weapon-attribute-dazing}}

If you Crit with the weapon, the target is \mylink{Woozy}{effect-woozy} for \DUR{d4} unless they're wearing a helmet.

\myskip

\mybold{\myanchor{Hewing}{weapon-attribute-hewing}}

Roll twice for damage and take the best.

\myskip

\mybold{\myanchor{Piercing}{weapon-attribute-piercing}}

The weapon is \mylink{Lethal}{combat-damage-lethal} and ignores Armor.

\myskip

\mybold{\myanchor{Rending}{weapon-attribute-rending}}

On a hit, you can optionally forgo damage and remove 1 \UD of target armor.
}

\cbreak

\callout {
\mybold{\myanchor{Splattering}{weapon-attribute-splattering}}

Using a Splattering weapon requires you to use the \mylink{Gambit}{combat-deeds-gambit} Combat Action if you wish to hit your mark. If you miss with one of the rolls, the weapon lands somewhere Nearby the target (your choice) and detonates. If both rolls fail, roll a d6:


  \mytable{c X}{
    \thead{Roll} & \thead{Effect} \\
  }{
    1-3 &  The weapon bounces off of your target, you drop it, someone throws it back, etc. The weapon lands Close to you and detonates. \\
    4-5 &  It was a dud!  Nothing happens. \\
    6 &  The weapon lands somewhere Nearby (Arbiter's choice) and detonates. \\

  }    
}


  \crunch{Complex Weapons}{gear-weapons-complex}

  If you want a little extra for your weapons, consider the following Attributes:


    \mybullet {
        \item Pistols and Muskets have the \mybold{Piercing Attribute}.
        \item Polearms have the \mybold{Rending Attribute}.
        \item War Axes and Swords have the \mybold{Cleaving Attribute}.
        \item War Hammers have the \mybold{Dazing Attribute}.
        \item Zweih{\UmlautA}nder have the \mybold{Hewing Attribute}.
