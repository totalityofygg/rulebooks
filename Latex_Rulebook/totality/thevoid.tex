\mysection{The Void}{the-void}

\flavor{We're at the edge of Everything. \\~ \Tilde Planet Cruiser, "Riders Of The Edge"} 

    The Totality is everything, and everything is the Totality. At the heart of the Totality lies the Void, and at the center of the Void grows the Tree of Ygg.

    A profusion of flowers and blossoms thickly cover the eternal branches of the Tree, each a universe or multiverse itself, their fronds and florets waving in the torrential winds of the screaming Void. Within these trillion trillion plumules, evolution thrives, aspiring towards intelligence, an infinite number of variations as the Tree seeks to understand itself. At the edges of each bloom black holes collide and suns go supernova, and dead universes drift in the winds of the Void like sparks from an anvil.

    On one of the unending shoots on one of these eternal branches a flower grows, its petals and sepals binding \mylink{the Dream}{the-dream} within itself\footnote{Though perhaps it is \TheAuthority who has dreamed the flower inside of the Void.}. Where the Dream thins to nothingness, the Void rushes like a flood, seeping in at the edges and perverting the intent of the Dream, a splinter in the mind of reality.
