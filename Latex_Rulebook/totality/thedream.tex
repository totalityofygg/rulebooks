    \flavor{But at the Last will \ManaYoodSushai forget to rest, and will make again new gods and other worlds, and will destroy the gods whom \ManaYoodSushai hath made. And the gods and the worlds shall depart, and there shall be only \ManaYoodSushai. \\~ \Tilde Lord Dunsany, \myital{The Gods of Pegana}}

    The Totality is everything, and everything is the Totality. At the heart of the Totality lies the Void, and at the center of the Void grows the Tree of Ygg, and on one of the unending shoots on one of the eternal branches inside one of the trillion trillion plumules blooms a flower - the Dream. 

    Within the Dream \TheAuthority sleeps and dreams reality. We exist because \TheAuthority dreams it so. The Dream brings order and purpose to the Void. Atoms of thought spring from the mind of the slumbering Dreamer, and are named the \mybold{Small Gods} by the \mylink{Mortals}{the-inhabitants} they have created. Mortals inherit their souls from their procreators, and play out their parts in \mylink{the Great Game}{the-game}, manipulated by the Small Gods towards stratagems and aims only guessed at.  \mylink{Tartarus}{the-spheres} and the Five Dwarfs and all the creatures who dwell on them are part of the divine hallucinations of \TheAuthority. Outside of the Dream lies nothing but chaos and madness.

    It is heresy for Mortals to pray to \TheAuthority, the God of Having Done, for if their prayers were to awaken \TheAuthority it would bring about \TheEnd. Instead they whisper their orisons to the Small Gods, the Gods of Doing, the Builders who glitter like fireflies around their creator. These Mortals pray for mercy, and that they not be used too harshly or sacrificed needlessly in the ends of the Great Game.
