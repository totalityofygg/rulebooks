  \mysubsection{Hammerspace}{meta-hammerspace}

  \flavor {
    "... a fan-envisioned extradimensional, instantly accessible storage area in fiction, which is used to explain how animated, comic, and game characters can produce objects out of thin air." 
  }

Items placed in Hammerspace can't be stolen, used, or obtained by others. When you die, objects in Hammerspace immediately return to reality (how that happens is up to the Arbiter, but I like to imagine they erupt around you like Sonic the Hedgehog losing rings). Certain spells, auguries, etc. can inform someone whether or not you have items stored in Hammerspace. You can't put one Hammerspace object in another (they repel like magnets).

No one is really 100\% on how long a living thing can survive in Hammerspace.

\mysubsection{Real Time}{meta-time}

Real Time is the amount of time that transpires for \mybold{you} while you're around the table. If you are asked to mark Real Time (for an effect, spell, etc.), start a timer or mark time on a clock. This is different than "Game Time" (described above).


\mybold{\myhighlight{\SUM minutes}{time-minutes}}

Certain effects, abilities, etc.\ might have a duration of \SUM minutes. The Arbiter should use a stopwatch or clock to measure the passage of time. You can ask how many minutes are left and get an answer, but the Arbiter is under no obligation to volunteer how much time remains if she doesn't want to.

\mybold{\myhighlight{The Session}{time-session}}

A \mybold{Session} begins when you and your friends sit down to play; the Session ends when the game stops and everyone goes home. There are certain effects in the game that have a duration of "Session", meaning when the game stops, the effect ends.

\mybold{\myhighlight{The Adventure}{time-adventure}}

An \mybold{Adventure} consists of one or more Sessions. When your \mylink{Band}{roles-band} writes the last line of a chapter of their exploits, they complete an Adventure  (for example: Thundarr breaks the werewolf curse; Conan escapes the Demons of the Summit; Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser return to Lankhmar with Ohmphal's fingertips, etc.) More information on the Adventure can be found in the section on \mylink{Advancement}{advancement} and the section on \mylink{The Arbiter's Step}{downtime-arbiter} under \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}.
