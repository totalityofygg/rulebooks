  \mysubsection{Afraid}{effect-afraid}

  If you are Afraid of something, you must make an \mylink{Insanity}{adventurer-kismet-insanity} try when you approach or attack the object of your fear. If you damage the object of your Fear, the Fear is immediately dispelled.

  \mybold{Effect on Monsters:} If a Monster is Afraid of something, it will try to run away.  If left to its own devices, it will hide in the adjacent room / area that is most safe and return when the duration is up.  Monsters resist Fear with a morale check.

  \mysubsection{Anathema}{effect-anathema}

  You cannot benefit from magical healing or be the target of helpful magic (note: \mylink{Leechcraft}{arcana-leechcraft} isn't magical healing).  You automatically fail any \SAVE{Hexes}, and you cannot gain Glory through Carousing.

  \mybold{Effect on Monsters:} The Monster cannot regenerate; Save tries are made at a -4.

  \mysubsection{Befuddled}{effect-befuddled}

  If you are Befuddled, you cannot tell any two creatures apart - everyone looks the same. Whenever you attack, you attack a random creature.  When you cast a spell, you cast a random spell at a target picked randomly from all eligible ones.  Whenever you try to run through a door, you run through a random door.  The Arbiter should feel free to dictate additional effects as necessary.

  \mysubsection{Bleeding}{effect-bleeding}

  \mysubsection{Blinded}{effect-blinded}

  You can't see. You automatically fail \RO and \RB tries, Init rolls, and any Skill that requires sight.

  \mysubsection{Diseased}{effect-diseased}

  The section on \mylink{Diseases}{vulgate-medicine-diseases} is detailed in the \mylink{Vulgate of Medicine}{vulgate-medicine}. Just before the end of each Session, anyone who has come Close to the infected must \RSTRY{\VIG}; if they fail, they become infected with the disease as well.

 \mybold{Effect on Monsters:} Arbiter's discretion.

  \mysubsection{Disgusted}{effect-disgusted}

  You fight through your feelings of revulsion or horror, but all \RO and \RB tries have a -4 modifier as long as you are in the presence of the object of your disgust.

  \mybold{Effect on Monsters:} As long as the Monster is in the presence of the object of its disgust, Attack and Guard tries against the Monster are made at +4.

  \mysubsection{Disarmed}{effect-disarmed}

  Can only affect things held in one hand (like 1h weapons). The item is ripped from your grasp and falls to the ground.  It will take an Action to recover it.

  \mysubsection{Drunk}{effect-drunk}
  
  You take a -1 on any and all \RO and \RB tries, depending on how Drunk you are (you'll see this written as \mybold{Drunk -1}).  You can continue drinking if you desire, taking a cumulative -1 each time, until you reach \mybold{Drunk -4}. Continuing to drink after that point can result in an \mylink{Overdose}{gear-narcotics-overdose}.  The only guaranteed cure is to sleep it off (take a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}).  At the end of your Bivouac, make a \RSTRY{\VIG} - Fallout means you are \mylink{Hung Over}{effect-hung-over}. See the section on \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} for more info. 

  \mybold{Effect on Monsters:}  Arbiter's Discretion.

  \mysubsection{Enflamed}{effect-enflamed}

  Dear sweet God, you're on fire! You take d4 damage at the Top of the Moment. The damage die moves \DCUP every Moment afterwards (d6, d8, etc). Damage from the fire bypasses Grit but can be blocked by Armor.

You can douse the flames by spending an entire Moment (2 Actions) performing "stop, drop, and roll".  This can be shortened to a single Action if someone helps you douse the flames. While you're rolling around on the ground, you're \mylink{Prone}{effect-prone}.


  \mysubsection{Enraged}{effect-enraged}

  You immediately attack the closest Monster, dealing +2 damage whenever you strike. You cannot become \mylink{Afraid}{effect-afraid} while you are Enraged, and you cannot do anything defensive, curative, tactical, or cooperate with your Allies. Spellcasting is impossible. If the closest Monster isn't a living thing (a trap or what-have-you), you will attempt to destroy it as quickly and directly as possible. You cannot stop fighting until all the Monsters are dead or have fled (further than Far-Away).  If an Ally hurts you (accidentally or otherwise) during your rage, they are considered a Monster.

  \mybold{Effect on Monsters:}   The Monster gains the \mylink{Rage}{monster-action-rage} Combat Action.

  \mysubsection{Hung Over}{effect-hung-over}

  Roll a d4.  1) You are at -4 on all \RO and \RB tries;  2) You are \mylink{Sickened}{effect-sickened};  3) You are \mylink{Concussed}{effect-concussed}; 4) You are \mylink{Woozy}{effect-woozy}.  The effect lasts until it is removed by Leechcraft, removed with an appropriate tonic (Chymistry) or narcotic, you Bivouac, or you take a number of points of \mylink{Drunk}{effect-drunk} equal to or greater than the number on the die.

  \mybold{Effect on Monsters:}   Arbiter's discretion.
