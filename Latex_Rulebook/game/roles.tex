    All the worldâ€™s a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances,
    And one man in his time plays many parts ... \\~

Playing the Totality of Ygg requires at least two people - the Arbiter and one or more players - who between themselves create the world populated by \mylink{Adventurers}{the-adventurer} and \mylink{Monsters}{monsters}. 


\mysubsection{The Arbiter}{roles-arbiter}

Referee, Judge, Storyteller, Game Operations Director (G.O.D.), Game Master - the Arbiter goes by many names in many games and many genres. It's up to the Arbiter to create the world where Adventurers find riches and glory, or ignominy and death.  The Arbiter also acts as the game's referee, and as such should be the person most familiar with the rules.\footnote{The rules hopefully aren't too daunting; they were created with the Arbiter in mind. As the life-long Game Master of my various groups, I wanted to make things as easy as possible for the Arbiter while still allowing the most flexibility and (hopefully) fun. See the section on \mylink{Arbiter's Resources}{arbiter} for more info!}

\mysubsection{The Adventurer}{roles-adventurer}

The players control one (or more) \mylink{Adventurers}{the-adventurer}, interacting with the Arbiter and the world they've created - going on quests, looting dungeons, and living life far out beyond the edge of what is "safe". You can read more about Adventurers in the next section.


\mysubsection{The Band}{roles-band}

\flavor{It is dangerous to go alone! \\~ \Tilde Legend of Zelda}

The dangers outside of the walls of the \mylink{Settlements}{civilization-settlements} can rob you of your life and sanity in no particular order, so Players are encouraged to get a band (back) together. A Band consists of a group of Adventurers with a common purpose as well as any "roadies" (\mylink{Henchmen or Hirelings}{gear-henchmen}) you pay to carry torches and check for traps. Name your Band\footnote{Some examples from our playtests - the Blood Eagle Electrum Company, the Mobos, Mel's Minions, the Iron Maidens} and make your mark!

\mysubsection{The Monsters}{roles-monster}

Adventurers will often find themselves striving against \mylink{Monsters}{monsters}, usually "placed" into the game world by the Arbiter. "Monsters" could be a group of peasants armed with pitchforks, a timed trap, a cliff wall, or a swarm of bees\footnote{It could also be a monster.}.
