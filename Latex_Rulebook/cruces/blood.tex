\mysection{The Crux of Blood}{cruces-blood}

\flavor{"Blood aids great sorcery!" thundered Xaltotun, in a voice that made the rocks quiver \Tilde Robert E. Howard, \myital{The Hour of the Dragon}}

\mylink{Limbo}{the-afterlife} is the purpose of the Dream; it captures the Void inside of itself, traps it for use by the Mortals audacious enough to wield its awesome power. Limbo is a prison of potential, for manifold are the demons that dwell inside, battering against the walls of the Dream. 

Your soul rides close to the tatters of Limbo, and bargains with these creatures for power. They seek blood in payment - the sap of Ygg, the brine of the Six Seas, the fire inside the calderas that felled Atlantis. Blood is life, and they desire it more than anything. Blood aids great sorcery. Blood is power.

By mastering the Crux of Blood, you bargain with the demonkind of Limbo to learn the \mylink{the Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets} that lie beneath \mylink{the Arcana of Wizardry}{arcana-wizardry}, and manifest these Secrets using your \mybold{Blood Dice}.


\mysubsection{The Blood Die}{cruces-blood-dice}

The Blood Die is a \POOLD{d6} used to manifest \mylink{Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets}. You must declare how many Blood Dice you are rolling before you invoke a Secret. If a Blood Die comes up a Failure (a 1 or a 2), it is immediately \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent}.

Your Blood Dice are inhibited by the proximity and amount of iron nearby. Possessing a few iron pieces, a dagger, or being shackled in manacles is OK (though it might give you a headache), but wearing chainmail, carrying an iron short sword, or being closely imprisoned behind iron bars completed hinders you. The extent of iron that obstructs the use of your Blood Dice is at the discretion of the Arbiter.

\cbreak

  \myimage{cruces/Philosopher_1}

To utilize your Secrets, you must declare and roll one or more of your Blood Dice.  How many is up to you - the more dice you roll, the more powerful the effect, but the higher the chance of catastrophe:

\mybullet {
  \item If you roll any triples, you suffer a \mylink{Mishap}{table-mishap}. The spell works, but you must roll on the Mishap table below.
  \item If you roll any quadruples, you suffer a \mylink{Calamity}{table-calamities}. The spell \myital{fails}, and you must roll on the Calamity table below.
  \item If you roll any quintuples, you suffer a \mylink{Ruin}{table-ruin}. The spell \myital{fails}, and you must roll on the Ruin table below (this will most likely kill you - if you're lucky).
}

Blood Dice are restored by taking a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac} or longer rest. If you find yourself out of Blood Dice but still wish to perform \mylink{Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets}, you can attempt to ride \mybold{Ride the Tiger}.

\end{multicols*}

\mysubsection{Ride the Tiger}{cruces-blood-ride-the-tiger}

If you run out of Blood Dice, you may take a Combat Action to allow a demon of Limbo to gain purchase in your soul, channeling its power directly through your connection to the Dream. 

Roll a single d6. If you do not roll a Failure, you may use its \SUM to immediately cast one of the Secrets you know. If you roll a Failure, however, you suffer a \mylink{Calamity}{table-calamities}. The die is temporary and is Spent as soon as it's rolled.

You can increase the amount of Blood you can channel through the Philosopher Virtues \mylink{Discordian}{philosopher-virtue-discordian}, \mylink{Anarchist}{adv-philosopher-anarchist}, and \mylink{Kallisti}{adv-philosopher-kallisti}.

If you roll multiple d6 when Riding the Tiger and \myital{the majority} of the dice come up a Failure, it results in a Calamity. The rules for triples, quadruples, and quintuples still apply. 

You may Ride the Tiger as many times as you dare.

    1 &  Arbiter's choice. \\
    2 &  When you take damage to Flesh your body gushes saltwater instead of blood. Tiny translucent organisms and vibrant crustaceans you never imagined writhe about on the floor. \\
    3 &  You grow thick white hair all over your torso.  No matter how many times you shave, it comes back. \\
    4 &  Your eye color changes (doesn't affect sight): 1) blood-red and goat-like; 2) white and pupiless; 3) yellow and cat-like; 4) kaleidoscope. \\
    5 &  You let out a deafening fart, extinguishing all Nearby torches and candles. \\
    6 &  Brightly colored sparks fly from your ears. \\
    7 &  An acrid stench wafts over you as every hair on your body decomposes. You lose all your hair and it never grows back. \\
    8 &  Your tongue changes (doesn't affect speech): 1) forked; 2) long (down past your chin); 3) black and scaly;  4) two tongues! \\
    9 &  Your ears change (doesn't affect your hearing):  1) they fall off; 2) they become pointed and really long like an anime elf; 3) they become cat's ears and move to the top of your head; 4) they become long and floppy, like a basset hound. \\
    10 &  You grow small ridged scales on your back, from your shoulders to your tailbone.  They itch terribly unless they are moistened occasionally.   \\
    11 &  You grow a ruff of feathers around your neck.  You like to keep them well preened. \\
    12 &  You grow a beard down to your chest, regardless of your gender.  The beard cannot be shaved off but it can be styled.  The color of the beard is: 1) white; 2) blue; 3) jet black; 4) rainbow.  \\
    13 &  Your fingernails all grow to 5cm in length.  Trimming them never helps. \\
    14 &  One of your feet changes into a : 1) hoof; 2) chicken foot; 3) copy of the other foot (2 left feet); 4) backwards foot.  This doesn't affect your \MD. \\
    15 &  Roll a d4.  Grow that many extra fingers, distributed on your hands however you want.  (the fingers have no other benefit, but buying gloves is more difficult). \\
    16 &  The hair on your head always stick straight out, and changes color to: 1) bone white; 2) bright blue; 3) jet black; 4) rainbow colored, like a clown wig. \\
    17 &  Your nose changes (doesn't affect your sense of smell):  1) falls off and becomes 2 nostril slits; 2) becomes elongated and warty; 3) becomes a pig's snout; 4) becomes a mouth (can't talk). \\
    18 &  A tiny raincloud appears directly over your head and begins raining.  Hard.  Everyone Close to get you will get drenched, as will every light source. The raincloud lasts for the remainder of the Session. \\
    19 &  Your footsteps produce: 1) wisps of smoke; 2) a faint sulfurous smell; 3) birdlike footprints, no matter what footwear you're wearing 4) no footprints at all. \\
    20+ & Nothing happens. \\

    1 &  A dripping ball of smoldering black sludge consumes your heart, burning a hole through your chest. You still live, but you are now \mylink{Unhallowed}{effect-unhallowed}. \\
    2 &  Everything Nearby with a mouth must \SAVE{Doom} or vomit slick red fish for \DUR{d4}.  While vomiting they are effectively \mylink{Paralyzed}{effect-paralyzed}. \\
    3 &  A mouth grows from a random location on your body. For the most part it just breathes loudly and tries to bite anything that comes near it, but as soon as you tell a lie it will yell the truth. \\
    4 &  d4 small hard nodules push out of your shoulders around the base of your neck. They continue to grow and twist out into hard, ridged horns, like some kind of morbid cage collar behind your head, and within a month they're a half meter long.  \\
    5 &  Your jaw dislocates and your throat dangles like a sack. Your jaw now hinges on over-elasticized tendons and your throat can stretch and swell like that of a pelican or frog. \\
    6 &  Your head and face swell and turn black, and the flesh begins to peel away. At the end of the Session your head is replaced with that of 1) a bat; 2) a tiger; 3) a cobra; 4) a lizard. \\
    7 &  The skin of your back becomes porous and elastic and you sprout thousands of thick dry skin tags. Your tongue can now extend 3 feet in length and sweats some kind of oil, and you find yourself licking your back to relieve the pain. \\
    8 &  Hundreds of waving blueish 20cm long tendrils grow below your jaw and down your throat.  \\
    9 &  Your legs become pudgy and pink; your feet become cloven like a pig's; and two fat, pliable pink arms grow from just above your hips. The arms can't move, and wearing shoes is painful. \\
    10 &  Weirdly oblong, mouth-shaped barnacles cover random locations on your body. In times of stress they explode in a cloud of white spores, and you feel the sensation of being wildly licked by multiple tongues over the area by something you cannot see. The barnacles will regrow in a new location at the start of the next Session. Don't try to find the things that lick you ... \\
    11 &  Vaguely translucent oyster-like keratin growths appear in multiple places on your body, particularly around your neck and face. \\
    12 &  You can't stop drooling black bile. If you regurgitate a pool of it small eyes emerge and float about. \\
    13 &  You grow a set of breasts in addition to any you may have already. These breasts constantly leak a bitter smelling amber fluid. You keep waking up with small soft crawling things with bright eyes feeding from you in the dark. \\

    14 &  A random part of your body begins to swell, and fine layers of sticky silk thread develop over it until it is no more than a webbed mound. Delicate pure white moths constantly fly in and around it. If you cover it the flesh beneath burns, making it impossible to perform Secrets. Every now and then it will burst in a cloud of small flying moths that seem to be whispering something. \\
    15 &  Your nose becomes an ideal environment for the incubation of hundreds of small seed-shaped slippery tags of flesh, like a capsicum. If the seeds aren't harvested daily you are likely to become a target for birds and rodents. \\
    16 &  Thick mounded glands swell from the sides of your throat, when pressed they secrete a pungent black grease. Female rats are drawn to you, forming a protective maternal coven. \\
    17 &  Luminous orange anemone fronds grow in and around your eye sockets, engulfing your eyes. You now possess \mylink{Darksight}{effect-darksight}. \\
    18 &  Your eyes boil and burst and the skin of your arms and hands splits as new eyes bubble out like eggs on a frog's back.  No-one can get the \mylink{Drop}{combat-drop} on you. \\
    19 &  Fluted holes appear in your skin near hard areas of bone, particularly your elbows, shins, shoulders and spine. A colony of glassy purple ant-like creatures takes residence inside your bones, feeding on the marrow. Your \MAX Flesh is reduced by 2, but your \MAX Grit is increased by 8. \\
    20+ & Roll on Mishaps instead. \\

  \mytable{l X} {

    1-2 &  You die and dissolve into a pool of blood. The depth of the pool is unfathomable, and shadowy figures can be observed moving within. Those who step into the pool will be forever swallowed up and disappear into the depths, lost to space and time. \\
    3-4 &  You find yourself holding a piece of chalk and instinctively draw a door on a nearby flat surface. To your surprise, the door becomes real and opens into a dark cave. You venture inside, but never re-emerge. Your companions hear eerie slithering sounds coming from within the cave, and if they dare to enter, they too are never seen again.\\
    5-6 &  The lights go out. Your companions, with glowing white eyes, attack you viciously, devouring your flesh without taking the time to chew. Your attempts to defend yourself are ineffective and you soon disappear. Your companions then gather around, their bellies bloated and hands and mouths stained with blood. The only evidence of your existence is your wax-sealed skull, placed in the center of their circle..  \\
    7-8 &  You are wracked with unimaginable pain and turn white hot.  It is impossible to look at you.  There is a high pitched screaming on the air, like a tea kettle left on too long.  After a few Moments you detonate.  Everyone Nearby takes \LVL x d6 damage, \SAVE{Doom} for half.  You are very dead. \\
    9-10 &  Your head shreds open and a fountain of blood towers out of your kneeling body. The blood pours in surprising hues, splattering and spreading, revealing strange entities that reach out before slopping to the floor and transforming into something else. These things then give birth to even more creatures that crawl towards you with a gurgled scream before floating to the roof like a drop of water watched in reverse.  Your Band should probably seal the door... \\
    11-12 &  You lift into the air and d4 limbs tear themselves away from your body. Flesh rips and tendons snap, you watch as the limbs dissolve in mid air as if being digested before you drop to the floor.  You immediately begin Dying and \mylink{Bleeding}{effect-bleeding}. \\
    13-14 &  A second, naked version of you detaches from your body and falls to the floor, connected only by strings of pus and membrane. There is a 50\% chance that this naked version is actually you. The Arbiter will reveal the true identity of the "real" you at the end of the Session. If you are killed and the other version survives, or if it is allowed to remain with the Band for any other reason, they will become incredibly friendly and devoted to whoever forms a genuine bond with them. Once they form a close bond, they will always want to be near their friend and one night, while their friend is asleep, the other version's jaw will dislocate and stretch, attempting to swallow them whole. \\
}



\mytable{l X} {  
  } {
    15-16 &  For the next d3 Moments including this one, your head explodes and reforms itself.  Every Moment, roll all of your Blood Die for each Secret etched in your skull as if you were performing it on yourself.  You decide the order you want to roll in.  If you run out of Blood Die before you "finish", your head doesn't reform itself (and you die). You are unable to \mylink{Ride the Tiger}{cruces-blood-ride-the-tiger} in this state. \\
    17-18 &   A dozen hands push out in a line down your torso, drawing back your flesh like a stage curtain. When you look into the darkness it's like going through a tunnel until you reach yourself illuminated by a hundred tallow candles, seated upon a throne of flesh and bone, staring back down the tunnel into the abyss. You remain this way for Hours.  If you are moved during this time, the hands finish ripping you open and fold back in on themselves, killing you.  Otherwise, the hands pull your torso back together (leaving a hideous scar) and you immediately fall, and begin Dying.  \\
    19-20 &  Your throat expands and snakes begin to slide out of your mouth, your stomach splits open and piles of them slop to the floor, offspring slime out of their wombs and reach adulthood almost as fast as they are born, in turn giving birth to their own young, they slither across the floor in an ever expanding pile of writhing flesh and scales. They'll stop birthing after they've multiplied enough to fill a room 10m cubed (will take Minutes).  The snakes are a \mylink{Swarm}{monster-trait-swarming} and have 1 \HD for every square meter of space they would fill.  The snakes will attack everyone but you. Once they have all been birthed, you immediately fall down Dying. \\
    21+ &  Roll on the Calamity table instead. \\
