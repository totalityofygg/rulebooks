\mysection{The Crux of Faith}{cruces-faith}

    \flavor{And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought by the small gods, excepting only \TheAuthority, the Authority, the God of Having Done, who made the gods, and hath thereafter rested.  And none may pray to \TheAuthority but only to the gods whom he hath made. \Tilde Lord Dunsany, \myital{The Gods of Pegana}}

The Small Gods are purpose of the Dream; the atoms of creation dreamt by \TheAuthority. The Small Gods move Mortals across the cosmic chessboard of the Great Game, and seek your worship and remembrance in exchange for the Dream's true power. 

Worshiping \TheAuthority is forbidden; instead, your prayers and invocations are conveyed to these \mylink{Small Gods}{the-dream}, the Gods of Doing.  By mastering the Crux of Faith, you can bend the fabric of the Dream by practicing \mylink{the Arcana of Liturgies}{arcana-liturgies} and performing \mylink{Miracles}{wonders-miracles} to please and placate the Small God you are pledged to.




\mysubsection{The Faith Die}{cruces-faith-dice}

The Faith Die is a \POOLD{d4} used to invoke \mylink{Liturgies}{arcana-liturgies}. You must declare how many Faith Dice you are rolling before you invoke a Liturgy. If a Faith Die comes up a Failure (a 1 or a 2), it is immediately \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent}.  In addition, certain Liturgies will indicate that you must \mylink{Spend}{dice-spent} one or more Faith Dice. These dice may still need to be rolled, but they become \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent} no matter what shows on their face.

Faith does not return when it's \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent} (see \mybold{Losing and Gaining Faith} below); the Faith Die disappears until it is regained through acts of faith.  

\cbreak

\mysubsection{Losing and Gaining Faith}{cruces-faith-dice-recovery}

    You can only gain or regain Faith up to your \MAX by actively (even aggressively) pursuing your \mylink{Small God's}{the-dream} agenda on the Mortal plane.  You gain Faith completely at the Arbiter's discretion.  Some examples of things that might gain you Faith: slaughtering the priest of a rival cult; converting a crowd of listeners; invoking the name of your Small God and succeeding; eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and tripping balls while your Small God copulates with you; proclaiming your destiny, etc.

    It's possible to lose Faith through your actions, as well.  When you do something your Small God doesn't approve of or witnesses something which would shake your belief, you lose Faith Dice: a commune of the converted found diseased, deformed, and starved; a call for help which goes unanswered; a heretic speaking blasphemies in your presence, etc.

    The moment your Faith pool is completely \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent} (you have no Faith left), you must immediately roll an \RSTRY{d4}. If you succeed, gain 1 Faith; if you roll a Failure, you suffer a \mybold{Crisis of Faith}. You immediately lose all of the powers associated with your Small God and its Paradigm, as well as any Disciples you might have (including Vassals and Crusaders, and any followers you may have gained through the Virtue \mylink{Fishers of Men}{adv-mystic-fishers-of-men}). Roll on the \mylink{Crisis of Faith}{table-crisis-of-faith} table below. Until you perform a \mybold{Pilgrimage}, you must endure this painful loss. You cannot regain Faith while you are in the throes of this existential transformation of belief.

    Note that the Faith Dice contained in your \mylink{Holy Symbol}{liturgies-holy-symbol} are part of your Faith pool, and can protect you from having a Crisis of Faith. However, if you are separated from your Holy Symbol when you have no Faith pool left (it's stolen or taken from you), or you Spend the Faith that is inside of your Holy Symbol when you have no Faith left, you immediately suffer a Crisis of Faith.

\mysubsection{Pilgrimage}{cruces-faith-pilgrimage}

You must travel to a \mylink{Settlement}{civilization-settlements} that contains a \mylink{Shrine}{gear-services-shrines} to your Small God, and take \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}. If you aren't sure where a Shrine might be (or if the Arbiter is acting cagey), a successful \mylink{Skill: Lore}{adventurer-skills} try will tell you the location of the closest. The clerics, priests, nuns, monks, etc. of your religion may want you to perform some sort of penance before your Faith is restored (Arbiter's discretion); at the end of the penance, the Pilgrimage is considered fulfilled.  Succeeding at a Pilgrimage ends any Crisis of Faith you may have, and you gain 2 Faith.  You can only perform a Pilgrimage when you are having a Crisis of Faith.

  \mybold{Roll a d20. If you roll a Crisis of Faith you've already survived, roll again}
  
  \mytable{l X} {  
  } {
    1 &  It's all a terrible lie, a huge cosmic joke. You become an apostate. Your Adventurer ceases to become a Mystic and must pick a new Trope until you make your Pilgrimage (if you even bother doing something so utterly pointless). The specifics of what this means are left to the discretion of the Arbiter. \\
    2 &  You are overcome with a sudden clarity - your Small God has abandoned you. You become \mylink{Enraged}{effect-enraged}. Your enemies are "every thinking creature Close or Nearby."  That includes your Band. If you survive, you hold nothing but contempt for those who maintain their religious beliefs - should you meet another worshiper of your Small God, you will become once again Enraged (this can make taking a Pilgrimage ... difficult). \\
    3 &    You fall to your knees and regurgitate page after page scrawled with your own writing. They are filled with lies about your Small God, filled with doubt and blasphemy, there is enough to fill a tome. You are filled with shame, and become unable to speak. \\
    4 &  Stigmata. Pain racks your body as if splintering wooden spikes were being pushed into your flesh, wounds stretch open and blood seeps out around the edge. The blood is dark and viscous and reeks of age. Your \MAX Flesh falls to a 1. \\
    5 &   You experience agonizing guilt and shame; you have failed your Small God in unspeakable ways. Any time you enter Combat, make a \RSTRY{\FOC}; if you roll a Failure, you are completely incapacitated for Minutes (the entire Combat). \\
    6 &  The integrity of the your flesh becomes dubious, you feel numb and lesions break out across your skin. Take double damage from all physical attacks. \\
    7 &  Your \mylink{Holy Symbol}{miracle-holy-relic} melts or crumbles into shards of refuse, like burrs pulled from a dog's fur. If you do not have your Holy Symbol, your non-dominant hand shrivels to a black stump permanently (this cannot be healed through a Pilgrimage, or via \mylink{Medicine}{vulgate-medicine}). \\
  }

  \mytable{l X} {  
  } {

    8 &  Your eyes are taken so that you might see more clearly. You are \mylink{Blind}{effect-blinded}. When your sight returns you recall phantom flesh memory glimpses that you would rather not understand. \\
    9 &  Animals shy away and cry aloud when you're near. You suffer \mylink{Anathema}{effect-anathema}. \\
    10 &  The floor splits and steam the color of orange rot billows out like a mushroom cloud. Darkness rolls within its mass and everyone Nearby but you must make a \SAVE{Doom}. Those who fail speak in tongues for the 15 (real world) minutes - no one can understand them. The effect for you lasts until you make your Pilgrimage (you don't get a Save).  \\
    11 &  Locusts the color of bronze infested with corrosion pull themselves from the pores of your skin and swarm around you. The locusts crawl over you, burrowing into your flesh, fly about your head, etc. They are mercifully dormant at night, allowing you to sleep, but during the day you are constantly \mylink{Befuddled}{effect-befuddled} as you stumble around in a cloud of wings and mandibles. \\
    12 &  Insect legs bristle out of your skin like hair, when you break them they leak the blood of infants died in the womb. It smells like Limbo.  You are unable to restore Grit until you make your Pilgrimage.  \\
    13 &  Visions of floating in the infinite while your Small God slowly consumes your mind and flesh fill your senses. It fills you with terror and/or ecstasy beyond the most potent drug. Pick a \mylink{Narcotic}{gear-narcotics} - you are \mylink{Addicted}{gear-narcotics-addiction} to it. This Addiction cannot be healed by \mylink{Medicine}{vulgate-medicine}. \\
    14 &  Your tongue burns with an intense heat, you open your mouth and spit something to the floor, you smell your roasted flesh, your saliva still pops and sizzles. The orange hunk of metal on the ground cools into an image of a plump locust, lying on its back displaying bloated clusters of eggs coating its abdomen like a lobster. Whether you keep the idol or not you dream of the Locust Queen until you make your Pilgrimage, of her desire for her children to blanket the land, of your special role in all this. You do not get any benefit from taking a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}. \\
    15 &  Any light sources Close to you blow out, dark clouds seem to cover the sun during the day, worms that you can only see because they're so much darker than anything around them squirm from the earth and wriggle around your feet. You float like a black fog across the earth. You can see out of this Darkness, but no one else can. \\
    16 &  You've lost your God's attention. Your terms of your Pilgrimage must involve a tithing or sacrifice of some sort, but otherwise nothing happens. \\
    17 & A manifestation of another god appears before you and proclaims that you have been worshiping a false idol. They give you this one chance of conversion; if you take it, gain 2 Faith and convert to the worship of this new god.  If you decide against it, you fall down \mylink{Dying}{combat-dying} and begin \mylink{Bleeding}{effect-bleeding}. Let your god save you now. If you survive and complete your Pilgrimage, gain 4 Faith instead of 2. \\
    18 &  Your god sets the parameters of your Pilgrimage, demanding that you recover a sacred relic from heathen hands and deliver it to a Shrine. The Arbiter should place the relic and those holding it no more than a few days away.  You instinctively know where it is.  If you regain the sacred relic, gain 4 Faith instead of 2. \\
    19 &  You sweat and shake with religious fever and are incapacitated for one hour (use a timer) or one Session, whichever is shorter. When you regain control of yourself, your Crisis immediately ends and you gain 2 Faith, as if you had made a successful Pilgrimage. \\
    20+ & You have a vision of your God playing \mylink{the Game}{the-game} ... and possibly losing. Embattled by forces you barely comprehend, your Small God beckons to you for aid. Immediately end your Crisis, and gain 4 Faith. If you are in Combat, add +4 to your damage (from any source) until the fight is over (Minutes).

\mysubsection{The Contract}{totality-the-contract}

The Small Gods must obey certain "rules" when dealing with Mortals (they will never deal with Unseelie under any circumstances):

\callout{\footnotesize{
\mynumlist {
  \item  The Small Gods must be true to their Paradigm.
  \item  The Small Gods must hear what Mortals have to say, and they must honor their bargains.
  \item  The Small Gods can only hear a Mortal's words - they cannot hear their thoughts.
  \item  The Small Gods must speak truth to Mortals about what is happening in distant places.
  \item  The Small Gods must prophesy honestly - though they may try to trick Mortals with their words.
}}}


\mysubsection{Divine Favor}{liturgies-divine-favor}

You may call upon your Small God to directly intercede on your behalf.  To do this, you must roll \mybold{all} of your Faith dice, and the \SUMDICE of the roll must be 35 or better.

The divine favor must be something your Small God would have some control over, based on their aspect (Arbiter's discretion).  For example, Vulcan (Small God of fires, volcanoes, and the forge, who sits beneath the Civilized Authority) might not be able to affect the curse of the Ice Queen.  

The Small Gods cannot violate the basic laws of \mylink{the Dream}{the-dream}:

\mybullet {
  \item Matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, as this is the demesne of \TheAuthority; they can only be transformed or changed from one form to another. Spirits in \mylink{Limbo}{the-afterlife} are beyond the reach of the Small Gods.

  \item Entropy always increases.  Time cannot flow backward; sword strikes cannot heal; you cannot "fall" against the direction of gravity. It is possible to suspend this Law (to roll back time, for instance), but only for a few Moments before it reverts to entropy again.

  \item The \mylink{Soul}{the-dream} cannot be removed by a Small God. A Small God cannot directly slay something on the Mortal plane.

  \item All matter and energy has a destiny in the Dream.  A Small God cannot cause matter or energy to do something that violates this destiny, and the ultimate destiny is only known to \TheAuthority. (Practically, this means the effects of a Divine Favor are up to the Arbiter's discretion in the end!)

}


The Small God may also demand a sacrifice of some kind, or expect payment later ...


\example {
  \mybullet {
    \item Time rolls back for a few seconds to stop a killing blow from falling, or to re-roll a missed Save.

    \item A powerful magical item or artifact needs to be sundered.

    \item A sea must be parted, a tunnel opened through a mountain, or a boulder pushed to seal an entrance.

    \item Stones and trees, or sand and ice, assemble themselves into a fortress to protect the faithful.
  }

\mysubsection{Finding Religion}{faith-finding-religion}

To play a Mystic of the Faith, you must declare the object of your veneration. The Small God you worship can be anything, limited only by your imagination (though if you're stuck, see the section on \mylink{The Small Gods}{appendix-d} in Appendix D). According to the rules of the Great Game, each Small God belongs to one of the 10 \mybold{Paradigms} (there are said to be 13 in all, 3 hidden from the eyes of Mortals).
