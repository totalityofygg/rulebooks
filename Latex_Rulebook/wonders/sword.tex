  As the green flames, stung by her runes, leaped up, and the heat of the fire grew intenser, she stepped backwards further and further, and merely uttered her runes a little louder the further she got from the fire. She bade Alveric pile on logs, dark logs of oak that lay there cumbering the heath; and at once, as he dropped them on, the heat licked them up; and the witch went on pronouncing her louder runes, and the flames danced wild and green; and down in the embers the seventeen, whose paths had once crossed Earth's when they wandered free, knew heat again as great as they had known, even on that desperate ride that had brought them here. And when Alveric could no longer come near the fire, and the witch was some yards from it shouting her runes, the magical flames burned all the ashes away and that portent that flared on the hill as suddenly ceased, leaving only a circle that sullenly glowed on the ground, like the evil pool that glares where thermite has burst. And flat in the glow, all liquid still, lay the sword. \Tilde The King of Elfland's Daughter

The Rom who have turned their backs on Elfland command the \mylink{Abandoned}{forgotten-abandoned} to do their bidding, and can bind the chaos of the Void to a bladed Mortal weapon - Spears, Swords, War Axes, and Zweih{\UmlautA}nder (\VIG); Daggers and Short Swords (\DEX). These magical weapons must be grounded to the Dream through Mortal anchors, inscribed as runes upon these legendary blades that burn like cerulean campfires in the darkness.

These enchanted weapons can strike any Monster that requires magical weapons to hit, and emit a bluish or greenish glow at all times (similar in luminosity to the light cast by a few candles) unless they are sheathed or covered. They are often named after their wielder or maker, including the powers of the runes on the blades:

\mybullet {
  \item The Hallowed and Indestructible Spear of Yoon-Suin
  \item The Thrice Deadly Dagger of Kos
  \item The Flaming and Twice Accurate Sword of Magnuss
}

By placing runes on the weapon, the Spriggan anchors the Void to the blade. \mybold{You can place a maximum of 3 runes on a weapon} - anything further may destroy the blade, transform it into glass, suddenly appear in the hands of a demon, etc.  The Spriggan's runes must be fixed to a Mortal creation to become "real." Each rune requires:

\mybullet {
    \item A \mylink{Wizard Sigil}{inscription-sigil-wizard} for each \mybold{Archaic Rune}
    \item A \mylink{Witch Mark}{occultism-witch-mark} for each \mybold{Fiendish Rune}
    \item A \mylink{Holy Writ}{miracle-holy-writ} for each \mybold{Seraphic Rune}
}

Because Spriggan can't handle iron, the material of the weapon must be exotic (silver, gold, etc.) or otherworldly (adamantium, meteorite).  The material needs to be available and should be worked out with the Arbiter. The cost of obtaining this material are in addition to the inscribing of the Rune above, and the costs in supplies, otherwordly bribes, strange elixirs, etc. as follows:

\mybullet{
    \item The first Rune costs 2,500\AU
    \item The second Rune costs 10,000\AU
    \item The third Rune cost 50,000\AU
}
