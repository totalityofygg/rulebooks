\mysection{Miracles}{wonders-miracles}

\callout {
    Miracle Working can only be performed on the \mylink{Shopping Step}{downtime-shopping} during \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}. Miracles are performed by sacrificing your Faith Dice (sacrificed dice are rolled if required, and removed from play); they must be performed on \mylink{Hallowed Ground}{miracle-hallowed-ground} dedicated to your Small God, and you must be in possession of a \mylink{Holy Symbol}{miracle-holy-relic}. Each Miracle you perform \mybold{will cost you 100\AG per Faith Die sacrificed} for the appropriate vestments, relics, prayerbooks, sacred snakes, etc. Miracles only take \mybold{Days} to perform unless otherwise noted.

}


\mysubsection{Ambrosia}{miracle-ambrosia}

Spend 1 Faith Die to create \UDD{d4} of \mylink{Provisions}{gear-equipment}. You can combine multiple \UD into a single \UD if you desire (see the section on \mylink{adding and splitting Resource Dice}{dice-asset}). These Provisions can be stored for use later. Anyone who partakes of these Provisions during a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac} receives the \mylink{Sacrament of Bless}{vulgate-sacrament-bless} (see the \mylink{The Vulgate}{vulgate}) in addition to the nourishment from the meal.

\mysubsection{Covenant}{miracle-covenant}

You seal a bargain between \mybold{the Suzerain} (yourself) and a Mortal \mybold{Vassal} by pledging your souls to your Small God after death.  A Covenant has to be given freely, but can be compelled by other factors (like a dagger to the throat).

You must Spend a minimum of the Vassal's \LVL +1 Faith (so if the Vassal was \LVL 3, you would need to Spend a minimum of 4 Faith). After the miracle is performed:

\mybullet { 
  \item You can give and take Faith from the Vassal as if they were a disciple (see the Legendary Mystic Virtue \mylink{Fishers of Men}{advancement-mystic-virtues} for more info).
  \item You always know where your Vassal is and feel any strong emotions (lust, hatred, etc) or physical extremes ("she's somewhere very, very cold") they might be enduring.
  \item You can't directly harm your Vassal (though you can command others to do so); your Vassal isn't likewise constrained.
  \item Your Vassal is immediately converted to the worship of your Small God.
  \item Your Vassal barely needs sleep, and eats and drinks sparingly (they do not need to roll Provisions when taking a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}).
  \item Your Vassal gains +\DICE points of "holy armor".  Damage is subtracted from this total first before it is applied to Armor, Grit, etc.  It can't be healed, but can be restored by paying a visit to a \mylink{Settlement}{civilization-settlements} and worshiping at an appropriate \mylink{Shrine}{gear-services-shrines}.
}

You and your Vassal can only have a single Covenant at any time.  The Covenant can be broken by one of you having a \mylink{Crisis of Faith}{cruces-faith-dice-recovery}; the death of you or your Vassal; or by mutual, peaceful agreement.

\newpage
\begin{multicols*}{2}

\mysubsection{Crusade}{miracle-crusade}

This miracle can only be performed on your Vassal (see Covenant above), transforming them into a Paladin of your Small God.

  \myimage{wonders/Crusade}

\cbreak

You must Spend a minimum of the Vassal's \LVL x2 Faith (so if the Vassal was \LVL 3, you would need to Spend a minimum of 6 Faith). After the miracle is performed:

\mybullet { 
  \item Your Vassal can use their Faith as if they were a Sellsword's \mylink{Prowess}{sellsword-prowess}.  If they're already a Sellsword, they now have 2 Prowess they can roll together or separately.
  \item Your Vassal can gain Faith on their own (they don't need you to give it to them) up to a \MAX of 3.
  \item Your Vassal gains an additional +\DICE points of "holy armor" (see \mylink{Covenant}{miracle-covenant} above).
}

You must name a \myital{jihad} important to your Small God: "wipe out the infidels of the Crawling Chaos", for example, or "bring the fingerbone of St. Sebastien to the reliquary in the Howling Wastes".  Similar to a \mylink{Geas}{occultism-geas}, any day not spent in the furtherance of the cause of the Crusade will lose your Vassal a single Faith die.  It's important to note that if you or your Vassal should suffer a \mylink{Crisis of Faith}{cruces-faith-dice-recovery}, the Crusade has failed and the Covenant is broken.


\end{multicols*}

\mysubsection{Golem}{miracle-golem}

A golem is a mortal-like figure, brought to life through magic.  Creating a golem requires additional gold for materials and effort:

\mytable{Y Y Y} {
  \thead{Type} & \thead{Cost} & \thead{Faith Dice} \\
} {
  Paper  & 50\AU  & 8 \\
  Glass  & 100\AU  & 10 \\
  Wood  & 500\AU  & 12 \\
  Clay  & 1,000\AU  & 14 \\
}

Golems requires a \myital{shem} - a slip of paper with a magical rune written on it through the miracle of the \mylink{Holy Writ}{miracle-holy-writ}.

Golems are completely obedient to you and respectful of other followers of your Small God; presenting a \mylink{Holy Symbol}{liturgies-holy-symbol} of your Small God is enough to keep them at bay, but only you can command them. If you should die, the golem will continue performing your last command in perpetuity.

\mybold{Golems are immune to the direct effects of any and all \mylink{Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets}, though they can be indirectly affected}

\myhighlight{Paper Golem}{miracle-paper-golem}

Paper golems are small (less than 100cm tall) creatures created for menial work.  They can carry up to 5kg of weight, can "fly" on gusts of wind (similar to how a chicken can "fly"), and walk and run as fast as a small child.  Paper golems record everything they see.  At any time, you can ask them a single question ("what was it you saw when you were in the Baron's chamber?", for example) and the golem will flatten itself into a scroll detailing what it "saw". The Golem remains a scroll forever more, with the symbol of the Small God embossed on the bottom of the scroll.  These embossed scrolls are very, very difficult to counterfeit - and the price if you get caught is high, as it would bring down the wrath of the entire church of your Small God.

Paper Golems can't be torn or defaced, but are not immune to fire.

\myhighlight{Glass Golem}{miracle-glass-golem}

Glass golems are 2m tall automatons filled with pungent herbs and combustible "smokes".  You determine the type of smoke at the point of creation. Glass golems immediately explode when dealt a forcible blow - a hit with a weapon, a fall from a height greater than 3m, etc. Smoke pours out of the golem at the point of impact to cover an area Close and Nearby. The smoke persists for minutes, but can be dispersed by wind. The effects of the smoke vary - a few options are below, but you can discuss with the Arbiter if you want to go a different way:

\callout{\footnotesize{
\mynumlist {
    \item Smoke of Chaos:  Every creature in the smoke who does not worship your Small God must roll a d6: 1-2) they are \mylink{Befuddled}{effect-befuddled}; 3-4) they are \mylink{Enraged}{effect-enraged}; 5-6) they are \mylink{Afraid}{effect-afraid}.
    \item Smoke of Heroes:  Every creature in the smoke who worships your Small God is immune to fear of any kind (including morale), and deals +4 damage.
    \item Smoke of the Holy: The ground covered by the smoke becomes \mylink{Hallowed Ground}{miracle-hallowed-ground}; this can be used to temporarily create Hallowed Ground, or dispel \mylink{Unhallowed Earth}{occultism-unhallowed-earth}.  Unhallowed creatures within the smoke take 1 damage per Moment. 
    \item Smoke of Medicines: Every creature in the smoke who worships your Small God is immune to \mylink{Disease}{vulgate-medicine-diseases} and \mylink{Injury}{adventurer-kismet-injury}
}}}

\myhighlight{Wood Golem}{miracle-wood-golem}

Wood golems are 3m docile, hulking, tree-like creatures possessing great strength. They are able to carry up to 50 Burden in their branches weighing up to 1,000kg total.  They can successfully break down non-magical doors, bend iron bars, and perform other feats of strength (Arbiter's discretion).  They walk at a slow, shuffling gate (d3 \MD).

Wood golems will never attempt to defend themselves.  They can take up to 77 points of damage - Chopping weapons deal double-damage, and fire deals triple-damage.  They will mindlessly stand wherever you command: in front of a doorway, in the middle of a fire, or charging dumbly into a group of Monsters.

\myhighlight{Clay Golem}{miracle-clay-golem}

Clay golems are giant (4m tall) faceless creatures created to protect or guard an area.  You must tell them what they must guard at the moment of their creation, and they cannot stray further than 100m from that spot.  

Clay golems house the soul of a \mylink{Vassal}{miracle-covenant} or \mylink{Crusader}{miracle-crusade} (the Vassal or Crusader must be bound to you, if you're the one building the Clay Golem). Your Vassal is ritually slain, and their blood is mixed with sacred earth and fire to create the clay giant. Your Vassal does not need to be a willing sacrifice, but remember you can't directly harm your Vassal.  The Clay Golem has all of the memories, skills, saves, and abilities of their Mortal form (including Virtues, Arcana, Grit, Flesh, etc.)  They are immune \mylink{Secrets of the Mind}{arcana-wizardry-secrets-alignment}, \mylink{the Drop}{combat-drop}, and \mylink{Toxins}{malignants-toxins}. They cannot speak and are have unswerving obedience.

Clay golems can house the spirits of willing heroes (Crusaders who wish to protect the temple forever, for example) or with those of unwilling enemies (forced to guard a forgotten hallway, or the temple of a heretic Small God).  When slain, the soul of the deceased will travel to \mylink{Limbo}{the-afterlife} to remain for 7 days before it departs.

\newpage

\begin{multicols*}{2}

\mysubsection{Hallowed Ground}{miracle-hallowed-ground}

Through the Miracle of Hallowed Ground, you consecrate a handful of earth and imbue it with positive energy and spiritual protection. Hallowed Ground must be stored in a \mylink{Sacred Vessel}{miracle-sacred-vessel} until you are ready to use it. When poured on the ground, the soil consecrates an area 10 meters in radius. If the ground that is consecrated is \mybold{Unhallowed Earth}, its damnification is removed. Otherwise no Unseelie or Unhallowed creature may enter Hallowed Ground unless they are invited by the Mystic who created it; and no \mylink{Witchcraft}{arcana-witchcraft} may be performed on its soil.


\mysubsection{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic}

A repository for Faith.  You may \mylink{Spend}{dice-spent} up to 4 Faith Dice, placing them in the relic at the time of its creation.  This Faith can be used by other Mystics of your Small God (as well as yourself) as normal; they become part of your Faith pool as long as the relic is in your possession.  The relic itself must be something "special" - a fingerbone of a Saint, a shroud, etc.  - at the Arbiter's discretion.  The more powerful the relic, the more Faith can be placed inside of it.

The Miracle of the Holy Relic is used to create \mybold{Holy Symbols}, a requisite for performing \mylink{Liturgies}{arcana-liturgies}.

  \myimage{wonders/Miracle_1}

\cbreak

\mysubsection{Holy Writ}{miracle-holy-writ}

Spend 1 Faith to write the word and the law of your Small God as seven sacred words on paper, papyrus, clay tablet, etc. Only you and other members of your faith can read the words; to others, they look like random squiggles, strange designs, or "primitive" carvings. A Holy Writ you create is unique, like a fingerprint or calling card. Unless you've seen a particular Holy Writ before, a \mylink{Skill: Lore}{skill-lore} try is required to determine the owner of the Holy Writ. A Holy Writ may be transferred to another object or person; Unhallowed creatures marked by a Holy Writ are \mybold{Hallowed} for either 7 days or until the end of the Session (whichever comes first). Otherwise, the Writ is transferred permanently to the object or person, and can only be erased by the faithful who created it or by sprinkling it with a pinch of \mylink{Unhallowed Earth}{occultism-unhallowed-earth}.


\mysubsection{Incorruptibility}{miracle-incorruptibility}

This Miracle can be performed on a corpse to stop it from rotting.  The length of time depends on the number of Faith dice Spent (roll the dice before you Spend them):  1 die: \SUMDICE Days; 3 Dice: \SUMDICE Weeks; 5 Dice: \SUMDICE Years; 7 Dice: \SUMDICE Centuries; 9 Dice: \SUMDICE Millennia. So long as the body remains on Hallowed Ground, it does not decay in any way.  If the body is removed from Hallowed Ground, it will begin to decay as normal. While the body is in a state of incorruptibility, its soul will not depart from \mylink{Limbo}{the-afterlife}. The body is immune to any \mylink{Witchcraft}{arcana-witchcraft}.

\newpage

\mysubsection{Sacred Vessel}{miracle-sacred-vessel}

Spend 1 Faith to create a cruet, chalice, paten, ciborium, etc. dedicated to your Small God:

    \mybullet {
        \item \mybold{Holy Water:} Any liquid poured into the Sacred Vessel (water, wine, beer - but not acid) turns to cool, clean water. Toxins and diseases are removed. Any Mortal who drinks from the Sacred Vessel heals 1 Flesh; any Unseelie who drinks from the Sacred Vessel takes 1 point of damage to Flesh. The Sacred Vessel can produce 7 draughts.
        \item \mybold{Divine Oil:}  Oil poured into the Sacred Vessel can be used to anoint Mortal (not Unhallowed) beings. Anyone anointed with oil from the Sacred Vessel gains divine favor: once per Session, they may \mylink{Nudge}{dice-nudge} a die they've rolled to a different adjacent face. The effect ends when used, or at the end of the Session - whichever comes first. The Sacred Vessel can anoint up to 7 Mortals.
        \item \mybold{Hallowed Ground:}  See \mylink{Hallowed Ground}{miracle-hallowed-ground} above. The Sacred Vessel may be used to hold Hallowed Ground until it is ready to be used.
}

Once the Sacred Vessel is used to create Holy Water, Divine Oil, or used to hold Hallowed Ground, it must be reconsecrated by sacrificing 1 Faith the next time you take Downtime. Until then, it is just a "normal" (though valuable) object.

\myimage{wonders/Chalice}

\mysubsection{Sin Eating}{miracle-sin-eating}

Spend 1 Faith Die to remove the effects of a single \mylink{Madness!}{injury-insanity-madness} or \mylink{Curse}{cunning-curses} on a single Mortal (including yourself). You may Spend additional Faith Dice to heal more than one person.
