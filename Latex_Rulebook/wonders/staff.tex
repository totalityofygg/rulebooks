\flavor{His staff! I told you to take the Wizard's staff! \\~ \Tilde Grima Wormtongue, The Two Towers}  


The Magic Staff can be a cane, club, wand, staff, caduceus, or walking stick; it is a necessary accessory for any Philosopher reaching the heights of their study. It must be made out of a special material: the more powerful the staff, the better the material must be.  If you're making an Novice's Staff you might need a branch from an ash tree from the Forbidden Wood.  If you're making an Archmage's Staff, it might need to be the femur of the Great Wyrm Vermithrax.  Work this out with the Arbiter!

All Magic Staves are 2-handed \DEX Bashing Brawl weapons that do d6 damage.  They can produce light at will (as a torch); can hit creatures only affected by magic weapons; and can dispel \mylink{Illusion}{secrets-illusion} with a touch (though this will prompt a \mylink{Wizard Fight!}{arcana-wizardry-wizard-fight} if the opposing Philosopher is present).

\mybold{A Magic Staff cannot have more than 3 powers}, but you can "mix and match" from any group as you wish (see below). These are just the most common abilities; you're encouraged to work out additional abilities with the Arbiter. Staff powers are unique - you cannot take a power more than once, even if they are of different tiers (you couldn't take Runed (1) and Runed (2), for instance).

Your \mylink{Ingenuity Die}{cruces-knowledge-ingenuity} only moves \DCDOWN on a 1 (instead of a 1 or 2).

    \item Power (Novice): 1x per Session
    \item Power (Warlock): 2x per Session
    \item Power (Archmage): 4x per Session
}}}

\myhighlight{Protection}{staff-magic-protection}

Once per Session, you may reduce the effects of a \mylink{Ruin}{cruces-blood-dice}, \mylink{Calamity}{cruces-blood-dice}, or \mylink{Mishap}{cruces-blood-dice} depending on the power of the Recklessness instilled in your Magic Staff:

    \item Recklessness (Novice): Eliminate the effect of a Mishap
    \item Recklessness (Warlock): Reduce a Calamity to a Mishap

}}}

This effect is in addition to any benefit you might receive from  \mylink{Virtue: Discordian}{philosopher-virtue-discordian}, \mylink{Virtue: Anarchist}{adv-philosopher-anarchist}, or \mylink{Virtue: Kallisti}{adv-philosopher-kallisti}.

\cbreak

\myhighlight{Runed}{staff-magic-runed}

Your Magic Staff has \mylink{Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets} inscribed upon it. You may invoke these Secrets instantly using your Blood Dice, as if they were inscribed in your \mylink{skull}{arcana-wizardry-skull}. The number of Secrets depends on the power instilled in the Magic Staff:

\callout{\footnotesize{
\mybullet {
    \item Runed (Novice): 1 Secret
    \item Runed (Warlock): 2 Secrets
    \item Runed (Archmage): 4 Secrets

The Secret(s) must be known to you (on a Fetish, or in a Grimoire) in order to scribe them on the staff.

\myhighlight{Scholar}{staff-magic-scholar}

You gain 2 extra \mylink{Research Pips}{research} that you may use when practicing \mylink{Chymistry}{research-chymistry} or \mylink{Inscription}{research-inscription} during \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}.

\myhighlight{Sharpness}{staff-magic-sharpness}

    \item Sharpness (Novice): Deal d8 damage
    \item Sharpness (Warlock): Deal d10 damage
    \item Sharpness (Archmage): Deal d12 damage
}}}


\myhighlight{Sorcery}{staff-magic-sorcery}
