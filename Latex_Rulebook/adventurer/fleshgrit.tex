When you take damage from fighting, mishaps, scrapes etc.\ it affects Grit first - dodging and weaving, close calls, little nicks, stunning blows, getting winded, etc. When Grit is gone you're too exhausted to ward off physical harm and you start taking damage to \mylink{Armor}{gear-armor} and Flesh. Flesh is generally pretty static; if you're ever at a point where you're taking damage to Flesh, you're getting pretty close to \mylink{Dying}{combat-dying}.

This also means that your Grit can exceed its normal "maximum" - especially if you're using \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} to feel great about yourself. During a \mylink{Breather}{combat-resting-breather}, you gain a little of your Grit back by patching yourself up and calming yourself down; more Grit can be restored by having a few \mylink{Smokes}{gear-narcotics-smokes} or a \mylink{Drink}{gear-narcotics-alcohol}, or by the jokes and luck of a \mylink{Pooka}{species-pooka}.

Your starting Flesh and Grit are defined in your Trope or Species.
