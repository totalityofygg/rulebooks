Adventuring is dangerous business, and it's not uncommon for Adventurers to receive permanent physical injury. If you survive Dying, or if something particularly heinous happens to you (a fall from a great height, thrown by a Giant, etc.) you must try your \INJURY die. If you roll a Failure on an Injury try, roll a d10 on the table below to see what happens.

Unless an Injury is \mybold{Permanent}, you can have it healed through \mylink{Medicine}{vulgate-medicine} - which means a visit to a \mylink{Settlement}{civilization-settlements} to recuperate. If someone in your Band knows the \mylink{Vulgate of Medicine}{vulgate-medicine}, they can heal your injuries; otherwise you must engage the services of a \mylink{Chirugeon}{gear-services}.

      3 & Badly broken nose; even when it's fixed you'll have difficulty smelling and tasting things from now on. No effect if you're wearing a \mylink{Helmet}{gear-armor} (unless you want a broken nose). If you've already had this Injury, roll again.  \mybold{Permanent} \\
      4 & Lose a finger or toe - your choice \mybold{Permanent} \\
      5 & Broken hand. You can't do anything requiring fine motor coordination (does not include \mylink{Arcana}{arcana} or \mylink{Whispers}{vulgate-whispers}). \\

You can't use 2h weapons. If you try to fight with your "off hand", your Attack \RO checks are at -4 and you deal -2 damage (minimum 1).

If it's your throat or neck, you are unable to speak, meaning you can't use any Arcana or Vulgates that require speech. \\
      7 &  \mybold{Chest}  Your (1-3 left, 4-6 right) chest and ribcage are injured. Any time you do anything strenuous (like Attacking, Guarding, or running away), make a \RSTRY{\VIG} try. If you Fail, you take \mylink{The Vapors}{effect-the-vapors}. \\

The Arbiter can ask for an Insanity try at any time if they warrant something extremely disturbing has happened. For example:  witnessing a member of the Band getting killed; encountering some horrifying creature you've never seen before; or surviving a brush with \mylink{Death}{combat-dying}. If you roll a Failure on an Insanity try, roll a d10 on the table below.

Unless an Insanity is \mybold{Permanent}, you can be rehabilitated through a dose of \mylink{Laudanum}{research-chymistry-laudanum}; through the miracle of \mylink{Sin Eating}{miracle-sin-eating}; or by the services of a \mylink{Chirugeon}{gear-services} in a \mylink{Settlement}{civilization-settlements}.

        1 & \mybold{Darkfear} You are terrified of the dark. You cannot sleep in darkness; you must have a burning candle or lamp by your side or you do not gain any of the benefits associated with a Bivouac. When you are in pitch darkness you are utterly helpless - you automatically fail any \RO or \RB tries. \\
        2 & \mybold{Foolhardiness} Your continued survival in the face of the unnatural has given you the irrational belief that you are invincible. You cannot retreat or withdraw from dangerous situations unless you are unconscious (or dead).\\
       3 & \mybold{Gluttony} You are overcome by the irrational belief that if you consume you will not be consumed by your fear. You refuse to wear armor since it's "binding".  If you Bivouac, roll your Personal Provisions 3 times.  Your extra weight counts as 2 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden}.\\
        4 & \mybold{Melancholy} You are consumed by depression and ennui. Before you make any \RO or \RB try, you must \RS{\FOC}. If you roll a Failure, you refuse to take the \RO or \RB try (if you are in Combat, the feeling goes away after a Moment).\\
        5 & \mybold{The Needle} Only \mylink{Drugs}{gear-narcotics} will stave off the gnawing terror. Roll a d12 on the \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} table - you are \mylink{Addicted}{gear-narcotics-addiction} to that substance. If it's not immediately available to you, you are immediately \mylink{Sickened}{effect-sickened}.\\
       6 & \mybold{Night Terrors} You are unable to Bivouac unless you first \INSANITY. Failure means you cannot rest, in addition to the effect of the \INSANITY try.\\
       7 & \mybold{Overwhelmed} Your madness has left you periodically deaf and dumb to the world around you as you retreat within yourself to escape your fear. Your \mylink{Grit}{adventurer-flesh-grit} is 0 while under the effects of this madness and can't be healed, and you always lose Init.\\
       8 & \mybold{Shot Nerves} Your madness has weakened your already fragile mental state.  Whenever you enter Combat or a stressful situation (determined by the Arbiter), roll a \RSTRY{\INT}.  If you fail you can only stand gawping in horror for the rest of Combat.  You cannot Attack or Guard, but you can be pulled / moved by Allies.\\
       9 & \mybold{Starvation} Your madness has inspired the irrational belief that if you deny yourself food you can deny the extent of your fear. Whenever you Bivouac, roll a \RSTRY{\FOC}  If you fail you are unable to consume your Personal Provisions (and thus get no benefit for resting).  You are unable to heal Grit.\\
      10 & \mybold{The Voices} You are continually distracted by a number of voices that only you can hear. Each time you roll Init, make an \RSTRY{\FOC}  If you fail you are \mylink{Befuddled}{effect-befuddled} for the rest of Combat. You fail all \mylink{Listen}{skill-listen} skill rolls.\\
