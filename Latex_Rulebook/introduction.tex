The Totality of Ygg is a fantasy heartbreaker written and designed by \mybold{Stefan Antonowicz}.

Cover design by \mybold{vil}.

Editing by \mybold{Anastasia Ordonez} and \mybold{Rob Rea}.

Playtesters were Anastasia Ordonez, Eric Coumbe, Javier Pe{\TildeN}a, Rob Rea, Bobby Plank, Lou Coelho, Cardell Kerr, Shane Burke, Rob Zasso, Bob and Arianna Steadman, Dan Quinn, and Dave Herling.  You guys - I couldn't have done it without you.  Thanks for your input and patience.

I used \LaTeX (TeX Live 2022) for the layout. The main font is Jackwrite, and icons are through the Fontawesome 5 library.

Original works by Anastasia Ordonez, Ulisse Aldrovandi, Gustave Dore, Harry Clarke, Henry Justice Ford, John Batten, Piranesi Carseri, Thomas Hood, X.B. Saintine, Guy Boothby, Martin Farquhar Tupper, Gaston Vuillier, Luigi Robecchi-Bricchetti and others are in the public domain. The cover art and the art for the "World" section are from vil. Some additional art here and there was generated by Jasper AI, and the rest I licensed from Adobe. 

\mybold{These rules are based off of Arnold Kemp's "Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLOG)", including Skerple's "Many Rats on Sticks" Edition}, both of which are published under the \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/}{CC BY-NC-SA} license. A lot of the flavor text, especially for the really outrageously awesomely weird stuff, as well as the ideas of Grit and Faith, come from Logan Knight's "Last Gasp Grimoire", and is used with his permission.

The \Murk are the denizens of the \mylink{Veins of the Earth}{atlas-veins-earth}, which is used with the permission of Patrick Stuart. The Spriggan hail from Elfland, a world created by Lord Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett a.k.a. Lord Dunsany, and are in the public domain. I've credited wherever possible, and I would encourage you to check their stuff out without delay. 

Save for the reservations below, these rules are also published under the CC BY-NC-SA license. You can find a copy at the back of the pdf. You should read it, but this essentially this means you can share or adapt the contents of this pdf as you see fit, provided you a) give attribution; b) not use it commercially; and c) if you redistribute, do it under the same license. This also means that permission is granted to photocopy or otherwise reproduce this work for personal use. 

The only reservation to that is vil's fucking epic artwork (front and back cover and the title page); Patrick Stuart's "Veins of the Earth" (ask him if you want to use it);  Logan Knight's "Last Gasp Grimoire" (ditto); and any art I licensed from Adobe.  Those things should be considered Product Identity, along with the name Totality of Ygg. Otherwise, have at it.

This work is dedicated to my father Raymond Antonowicz and his friend Dave Ryan, who were math and computer teachers in the 80s and true pioneers of nerd culture. They graciously allowed a six-year-old to participate in their campaigns, despite my notoriety for spilling sodas at least once per session (I was a very enthusiastic dice roller). Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
