    The Arcana of Witchcraft is practiced using your \mylink{\JUJU}{cruces-mojo-juju}. Unless otherwise noted, Witchcraft takes 2 Actions to perform. Performing Witchcraft requires only one hand, and does not require you to speak.

    \myskip

    When a corpse is Consumed by Witchcraft, it immediately disappears without a trace.

\mysubsection{Black Magic}{arcana-witchcraft-black-magic}

\NECRO[
  Name=Born of the Grave,
  Link=witchcraft-born-of-the-grave
]

Requires a snort of \mylink{Corpse Salt}{witchcraft-corpse-salt}.  In addition to the Salt's \mylink{narcotic effects}{gear-narcotics-corpse-salt}, you become as one born of the grave. Roll your \JUJU up to 4 times, gaining +2 Flesh for each roll. Additionally:

\mybullet {
    \item You are Unhallowed, breathe dirt as if it were air, and can speak Graveborn fluently.
    \item Any Allies that see you for the first time must try \INSANITY.  Monsters must try their morale.
    \item \mylink{Shades}{monster-order-shades-detail} and the \mylink{Walking Dead}{monster-order-walking-dead-detail} will ignore you (unless you mess with them).
}

The effect can be ended at will; otherwise, it lasts until the end of the Session or until your \JUJU is \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent}.

\NECRO[
  Name=Canopic Jar,
  Link=witchcraft-canopic-jar
]

You remove your own or an Ally's stomach, intestines, lungs, or liver and store them in \mylink{Hammerspace}{meta-hammerspace} until the end of the Session.  Try your \JUJU for each organ stored in this way. Each Canopic Jar is unique (you couldn't store two stomachs, for instance) and each person can only store one organ (you can't store both your stomach and intestines).  While the organ is stored in Hammerspace, you (or your Ally) are Unhallowed. When you remove the jar from Hammerspace, or at the end of the Session, the Witchcraft ends and the organ returns immediately to the body. Unwilling participants get a Save.

\mybullet {
    \item \mybold{Stomach:} You do not need to eat or drink.
    \item \mybold{Intestines:}  You can heal Grit even if an effect (like a specific wound) would normally prevent you from doing so.
    \item \mybold{Lungs:}  You no longer need to breathe (this makes talking impossible).
    \item \mybold{Liver:}  You are not affected by any ingested \mylink{Toxins}{malignants-toxins}.  If performed while under the effect of the Toxin, the Toxin is removed from the body along with the liver and placed in Hammerspace.  The Toxin must be dealt with when the liver is (presumably) returned to the body.
}


\NECRO[
  Name=Carnomancy,
  Link=witchcraft-carnomancy
]

You may heal 1 point of Flesh on a single creature for each time you try your \JUJU. The healed flesh will appear gray and bloodless; wounds are sealed with wire and crude staples.  Horrible scars are usually left behind.

Alternately, you can try your \JUJU twice to stitch a lost limb or hand to a stump. This requires an available limb of the appropriate size.  The limb rots quickly and a new one needs to be attached each Session.  You can "feel" what the limb feels (i.e. you can tell if the limb is holding something but not what it's holding; whether the creature is walking or running; whether the limb is hot or cold; etc).  While the stitched limb is attached, the creature is Unhallowed.


\NECRO[
  Name=Covenant of Blood,
  Link=witchcraft-convenant-of-blood
]

Try your \JUJU to anoint someone with blood from your pricked finger. They are Unhallowed for the remainder of the Session. Unwilling creatures get a \SAVE{Hexes}.

\NECRO[
  Name=Crown of Thorns,
  Link=witchcraft-crown-of-thorns
]

Try your \JUJU up to 4 times. A crown of blackberry thorns criss-crosses your forehead; blood leaks from your scalp. When anyone touches you, you automatically deal 1 point of damage to them for each time you tried your \JUJU. It makes no difference if the touch comes from a Monster or Ally. Note that they must physically \myital{touch} you; hitting you with a weapon has no effect on them. The effect can be ended at will; otherwise, it lasts until the end of the Session or until your \JUJU is \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent}.

\NECRO[
  Name=Laughin' Jack,
  Link=witchcraft-laughin-jack
]

Try your \JUJU. In a burst of blue flame and a whiff of brimstone, Laughin' Jack appears in your hand.  Jack appears as the blackened and burned skull of an infant, roughly the size of a grapefruit.  He emits a guttering, bluish corpselight from his eyes and mouth (treat as candlelight); if no one is looking at him, he whispers and chatters to himself in a language no one understands.  You may throw Jack (as a Throw weapon, obviously) using your \FOC.  Jack explodes for d4+1 damage on impact, and is able to strike creatures only hit by magic.  Throwing Jack is a Combat Action.


\mysubsection{Corpse Witching}{arcana-witchcraft-corpse-witching}

\colorcallout{toyeerieblack}{
    Corpse Witching must be performed on a Monster's or Mortal's corpse, no more than 7 days dead (by the law of \mylink{the Game}{the-game}).  Corpse Witching immediately \mybold{consumes} (destroys) the corpse, unless otherwise noted.
}

\NECRO[
  Name=Corpse Salt,
  Link=witchcraft-corpse-salt
]

Try your \JUJU to Consume a corpse, creating \UDD{d4} of \mylink{Corpse Salt}{gear-narcotics} - a coarse and gritty \mylink{Narcotic}{gear-narcotics} that can be stored in a tiny pouch or vial.  Corpse Salt is a necessary component in certain Witchcraft as well as sought out by \mylink{Philosophers}{trope-philosopher}.


\NECRO[
  Name=Corpse Tongue,
  Link=witchcraft-corpse-tongue
]

Spread \mylink{Corpse Salt}{witchcraft-corpse-salt} on a flat surface (be careful it doesn't blow away!) and try your \JUJU up to 4 times. Each time you try your \JUJU, try the \UD of the Corpse Salt. When you're done rolling, a spectral echo of the deceased manifests itself for \SUMDICE real-world minutes. The echo appears as a ghostly, floating phantasm resembling the deceased (including any fatal injuries). It will answer questions asked of it, but the dead only speak in \mylink{Graveborn}{idiolect-graveborn}. The phantom only knows what it knew when it was alive. It will answer all question honestly (the dead have no need of lies), but the words can be cryptic and unhelpful, especially if the creature has no reason to help you.  Corpses usually don't remember exactly how they died.

\newpage


\NECRO[
  Name=Death Mask,
  Link=witchcraft-death-mask
]

Try your \JUJU to remove a corpse's face and wear it as a mask.  You will look exactly like them (but not have their memories, skills, abilities, etc.)  The face quickly decays over the course of the Session, looking more and more grisly the closer you get to the end of the game. At the end of the Session both the face and the corpse it was attached to are Consumed.

\NECRO[
  Name=Death Scythe,
  Link=witchcraft-death-scythe
]

Try your \JUJU up to 4 times. You kneel down and pull a black scythe from the center of the corpse, which is immediately Consumed. The scythe is a 2-Handed Brawling \FOC weapon that deals d8 damage. Against Monsters of the same species, the scythe does +1 damage for each time you tried your \JUJU (for example, if the scythe were plucked from the corpse of a Troll, it would deal +1, +2, +3, or +4 to Trolls). The scythe is only usable by you and counts as a magic weapon; it does not have any \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden}. The Death Scythe only lasts for Minutes (the length of Combat).

\NECRO[
  Name=Exploding Corpse,
  Link=witchcraft-exploding-corpse
]

Try your \JUJU up to 4 times. A corpse Close or Nearby to you explodes in a shower of bone and blood.  Anyone Close to the corpse must \SAVE{Hexes} or take \SUMDICE damage.  Makes a really big fucking mess.


  \myimage{arcana/Crow}


\NECRO[
  Name=Zombie,
  Link=witchcraft-zombie
]

Try your \JUJU. If you don't roll a Failure, you raise a corpse to help with mundane tasks, test for traps, etc.  The corpse moves very slowly (d3 \MD) but doesn't need to eat, sleep, rest, or breathe. The corpse cannot Attack or Guard, and any damage the Zombie (including \mylink{Curse the Unhallowed}{vulgate-sacraments}) immediately destroys it. The Zombie has the strength of a normal person and can carry 25kg worth of stuff without tiring, but it'll need to be strapped to them (in a backpack or whatever). Arbiter gets final say on what's allowed. The corpse can obey one word commands i.e. "dig", "sit", "go", "stop", etc.  The corpse can only understand Graveborn. It is completely mindless and extremely literal. The corpse will obey your last command. You can have as many Zombies under your control as you wish, but they only exist until the end of the Session or until your \JUJU is \mylink{Spent}{dice-spent}. The moment the witchcraft ends, the Zombie falls to the ground and is Consumed.

See the Heroic Virtue \mylink{Master of Puppets}{adv-mystic-master-of-puppets} under \mylink{Advancement}{advancement} if you wish to raise a Zombie army to fight for you...
