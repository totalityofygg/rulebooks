Monstrous spell-casters roll one or more \UDD{d4} to perform their magic. Monstrous spell-casters do not suffer any ill effects from rolling triples, quadruples, or quintuples. 

Roll a d8 to see what their "basic" spell is, or choose from the list below. 


\myimage{monsters/Flavor_6}

\mybold{1. Bomb}
The Monster manifests a storm of frogs / ice storm / fireball / blast of seawater, etc. somewhere Close, Nearby, or Far Away.  Everyone Close to the manifestation takes \SUM+\DICE damage (Save for half), plus an incidental effect (things catch fire, fires are doused, etc.).

\mybold{2. Boost}
The Monster yells a rallying cry / summons the spirits of the ancestors / asks the Fates for a boon, etc. that can either grant a Monster a +\DICE bonus on damage or inflict a -\DICE \RO or \RS penalty on an Adventurer (Save negates).

\mybold{3. Fix}
The Monster is a mechanical genius / has healing saliva / restores the faith of the injured, etc. and can repair, heal, etc. \SUM+\DICE Health on themselves or another Monster.

\mybold{4. Shoot}
The Monster throws a magic dart / spits a viscous glob / shoots beams from its fingers / yells a word like a knife, etc. at an Adventurer Nearby, Far-Away, or Distant.  The projectile doesn't miss and deals \SUM+\DICE damage. 

\mybold{5. Stun}
The Monster breathes out a somnolent gust / lets out a stunning shriek / paralyzes with a look, etc. against \DICE Adventurers either Close or Nearby.  If the Adventurer fails their Save, they are slept / stunned / paralyzed for a duration depending on the number of dice spent:

  \mytable{c X c} {
    \thead{\DICE}  & \thead{} & \thead{\Duration} \\
  } {
    1 & & d4  \\
    2 & & d6 \\
    3 & & d8 \\
    4 & & d10 \\
    5 & & d12 \\
    6+ & & d16 \\
  }


\mybold{6. Aspect}
The Monster gains giant lobster claws / sticky hands like a fly / a hundred spider eyes, etc. for \SUM Moments.  The effect depends on the trait but should grant a +\DICE bonus (to damage, \RS checks, etc.).

\mybold{7. Armor}
The Monster summons a whirlwind of butterflies / a shield of shrieking shadows / the ability to blink in and out of existence, etc.  They gain \SUM points of protection - treat this as if it were extra Health, subtracting from this amount first.

\mybold{8. Summon}
The Monster summons \DICE Zoological / Elemental / Demonic creature(s) whose total \HD do not exceed \DICE (see the section on \mylink{the Obliterated}{forgotten-obliterated} for details.
