\newpage

\mysubsection{Mystic Complications}{mystic-complications}

    \begin{center}
        \myredbold{\large{Choose 1 of the following}}
    \end{center}

  \myhighlight{Animal Lover}{mystic-animal-lover}

  You love all kinds of animals; you refuse to ride beasts of burden (including being pulled in a cart by them), eat meat, or suffer the mistreatment of an animal (does not apply to animals that are actively trying to kill you).

  \myhighlight{Burn the Witch!}{mystic-complication-witch}
  
  Any time you stay in a Tiny \mylink{Settlement}{civilization-settlements}, you run the risk of being accused of witchcraft. If you stay in a Tiny thorp, dorf, etc. roll 2d6 - on a 2 (snake-eyes) you're accosted for poisoning the well water / getting the farmer's daughter pregnant (your gender is irrelevant) / making the chickens sick, etc. If you roll a 12 (boxcars), you'll be called on to do something important - deliver a baby, heal someone's fever, etc.

  \myhighlight{Cat's Eyes}{mystic-cats-eyes}

  Through some mishap, you have the eyes of a cat. They unfortunately don't allow you to see very well in the dark (treat as if you were holding a candle, probably enough to read by but not much else). They glow in the dark, however, making it difficult (though creepy) to sneak up on the unwary.

  \myhighlight{Heretic}{mystic-complication-heretic}

  Name a Small God. This God is heretical to your belief; its followers must be slain, its temples desecrated, and its name forgotten.

\cbreak

  \myhighlight{Imma Smoke It}{mystic-imma-smoke-it}

  You're constantly looking for new and better ways to transcend the mortal plane and see into the heart of the universe, i.e. to get high. If there's a weird mushroom, you're going to try it. Some kind of slime, put it in your pipe and see what happens. I hope you've decided to bump your Toxins Save.

  \myhighlight{My Name is Earl}{mystic-name-is-earl}

  You have set out on the path of the Mystic thanks to the help and sacrifice of another. You can never repay this debt, so you must pay forward kindness whenever possible. Tell the Arbiter what this debt is, and who you owe it to.

  \myhighlight{Otherworldly}{mystic-otherworldly}

  You are eerie, uncanny, and unreal. You don't cast a reflection, your footprints appear backwards, etc. Common folk want nothing to do with you; more powerful persons you meet hold you at arm's length. Tell the Arbiter what your alien nature is reflected in your Adventurer.

  \myhighlight{Transubstantiation}{mystic-transubstantiation}

  You require your own flesh and blood to fuel your \mylink{Cunning}{cunning} and \mylink{Miracles}{wonders-miracles} - not a lot, anywhere between a few drops and a goblet-full; a small slice off a limb to a fingertip's worth. The effects of using your own flesh and blood in this way can have ... interesting effects ... at the complete discretion of the Arbiter.

  \myhighlight{The Unseelie}{mystic-unseelie}

  The Unseelie are Unhallowed, anathema in the eyes of \TheAuthority. The Unseelie deserve your contempt at best, to be burned at the stake at worst.

  Alternately, the Unseelie are cursed and alone. They deserve your pity and understanding, and to be protected from the infantile fears and hatreds of Mortals.

  \myhighlight{Vow of Poverty}{mystic-vow-of-poverty}

  You have taken a vow of poverty. You will never possess more money than you need to live a basic existence; you live as humbly as you possibly can. You still insist on your full share of treasure, but you will donate it or give it away. 


  \mysubsection{Starting Gear}{mystic-starting-gear}
    \callout {
              \footnotesize {

    In addition to any gear you might have gained from Virtues, you have:
    

      \mybullet {
        \item 2 iron pieces; 
        \item a \mylink{Quarterstaff}{gear-dex-weapons} or two iron \mylink{Daggers}{gear-dex-weapons};
        \item \UDD{d4} of \mylink{Personal Provisions}{gear-equipment};
        \item 3 picks OR 5 rolls on the \mylink{Random Items}{appendix-a-random-items} table in Appendix A
      }
    }
}

\myhighlight{What Next?}{mystic-what-next}

If you're playing a "cleric" type of Mystic, start with the \mylink{Crux of Faith}{cruces-faith}. Understand the powers of your Small God's \mylink{Paradigm}{faith-paradigm} and the \mylink{Arcana: Liturgies}{arcana-liturgies} you can perform. Finally, you may want to take a look at \mylink{Miracles}{wonders-miracles}, which are "powered" by your Faith.

\cbreak

\myimage{tropes/Mystic_3}

If you're playing a "witch" type of mystic, start with the \mylink{Crux of Mojo}{cruces-mojo}. Understand how your \mylink{Juju}{cruces-mojo-juju} works, and take a look at the \mylink{Arcana: Witchcraft}{arcana-witchcraft} you can perform. Finally, you may want to take a look at and understand \mylink{Cunning}{cunning}, and how you can perform \mylink{Marvels}{cunning-marvels} and/or \mylink{Occultism}{cunning-occultism} with Cunning Pips.
