\myhighlight{Blademaster}{adv-sellsword-blademaster}

\myhighlight{Captain}{adv-sellsword-captain}

4 men-at-arms pledge their blades to your cause. They are \mylink{Mercenaries}{gear-mercenaries} in all ways like \mybold{Meatshields}, except they have a starting Loyalty of 9 and wear Light Armor. They can each carry up to 6 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} of gear. The require no pay or compensation, other than food (including providing Provisions during a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}). They will not tolerate other \mylink{Mercenaries}{gear-mercenaries} in your Band, unless they have been hired by another Adventurer. You have to specify what each man-at-arms is doing at the top of each Moment i.e. "2 are giving me +1 to Fight, 1 is giving me +1 damage, and I'm keeping one back to take damage in case things go south."  If a man-at-arms dies or leaves your service, they will be replaced with another during the \mylink{Production Step}{downtime-production} of \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}. Note that if your men-at-arms often meet with an untimely end, starve to death, leave your service, etc. you may begin to develop a ... reputation ... at the Arbiter's discretion.


\myhighlight{Charms}{adv-sellsword-charms}

You can perform the \mylink{Charms}{vulgate-charms} Vulgate at will.

\myhighlight{Command}{adv-sellsword-command}

If you are saving someone's life, they must be Close to you; if you are dealing a killing blow, you must be able to affect the Monster (Magic to hit, etc.). The amount of Health the Monster possesses has no bearing on the killing blow. Upon your demise, your soul travels to \mylink{Limbo}{the-afterlife} as normal. No Virtue short of \mylink{Norn's Shears}{adv-mystic-norns-shears} can save your life, but you will remain "barely alive" until the end of Combat, giving you a chance to say some epic last words.  Make 'em count.
