The armies of \mypg{Limbo}{the-afterlife} fight for the otherworldly and monarchical \mypg{Spriggan}{species-spriggan}, who summon and command the damned souls known as \mylink{the Forgotten}{the-forgotten}. The Forgotten consist of the \mybold{Obliterated} (echoes of ancient powers, their names long lost) and the \mybold{Abandoned} (Small Gods whose names are still remembered ... by you).

The beasts, elementals, and demons of Limbo owe allegiance to the King of Elfland, first among the \mylink{Unseelie}{the-inhabitants}. As a descendant of the Unhallowed God, you demand their sworn loyalty. Your \mybold{Sovereignty} reflects your ability to summon and control these creatures, a measure of your dominion. Sovereignty is your birthright, gifted to you through the lingering power of Elfland that flows through your veins. 

\mybold{Your Sovereignty starts at 1}.  You may summon a number of Forgotten equal to your Sovereignty before you must rest.

When one of the Forgotten \myital{Adjourns}, they immediately wink out of existence. Certain of the \mylink{Abandoned}{forgotten-abandoned} can take things with them when they return to the lonely plane they wander, but unless stated otherwise anything an Obliterated or Abandoned was carrying immediately falls to the ground.
