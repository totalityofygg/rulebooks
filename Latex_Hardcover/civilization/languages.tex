Thousands of cants and argots criss-cross the Five Dwarfs - divided into Dialects (languages that are regional within your world) and Idiolects (languages spoken by various species and tribes).

The only Dialect you need to worry about is \myanchor{Lingua Franca}{dialect-lingua-franca} - the common language of the Totality of Ygg.  Every intelligent creature can speak this tongue, whatever it might be.
