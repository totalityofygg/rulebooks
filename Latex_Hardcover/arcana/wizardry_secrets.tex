\mysubsection{The Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets}

In order to manifest a Secret, you must declare and roll one or more \mylink{Blood Dice}{cruces-blood-dice}. How many dice you decide to roll is completely up to you; the more dice you roll, the more powerful the Secret - but the greater the chance that you \mylink{Spend}{dice-spent} multiple dice, or roll a \mylink{Mishap}{table-mishap}, \mylink{Calamity}{table-calamities}, or \mylink{Ruin}{table-ruin}.  See the section on \mylink{the Crux of Blood}{cruces-blood} for more info on the Blood Die.

You must declare the number of Blood you are investing a Secret \myital{before} you roll; and you can't spend your Blood Dice if there is too much iron nearby. In Combat, speaking a Secret is a \mylink{Combat Action}{combat-combat-actions}.

\myhighlight{\faAnkh Alignment}{arcana-wizardry-secrets-alignment}

The Secrets are divided into a pentagram, each point aligned with a particular aspect of the Dream:

\callout{\footnotesize{

\mybullet {
  \item \mybold{Secrets of Biomancy:} Secrets that affect or utilize biological components;
  \item \mybold{Secrets of the Elements:} Secrets that utilize the four basic elements (air, fire, earth, water) as well as other ”elemental” forces (acid, lightning, etc.);
  \item \mybold{Secrets of Entropy:} Secrets that tap into the chaos and disorder native to the Void to either create or remove Chaos from the Dream;
  \item \mybold{Secrets of Force:} Secrets that affect the material world in some way;
  \item \mybold{Secrets of the Mind:} Secrets that affect the minds/brains of intelligent creatures (including illusions and enchantments).
}}}


Certain Monsters have, and other abilities provide, immunity to Secrets from certain Alignments. In those cases, the immunity is to the Secret itself and not from a "side-effect" of that immunity.  For instance, \mylink{Mindless}{monster-trait-mindless} Monsters are immune to the effects of the Secrets of the Mind (so they couldn't be \mylink{Charmed}{secrets-charm}), but could be attacked by someone who was themselves Charmed.

\myhighlight{Duration}{arcana-wizardry-duration}

Some Secrets will have a \Duration associated with them; the \Duration depends on the number of \DICE invested in the invocation of the Secret:

  \myctrtable{Y Y} {
    \thead{\DICE}  & \thead{\Duration} \\
  } {
    1 & d4  \\
    2 & d6 \\
    3 & d8 \\
    4 & d10 \\
    5 & d12 \\
    6+ & d16 \\
  }


  \myhighlight{Splittable}{keyword-splittable}

  Spells that can be split can have their dice split up among up to \DICE targets.  Each target resolves the effect of the dice on them separately, but the \DICE are pooled when considering Mishaps, Calamities, and Ruin.

  \example {
    The Wizardry arcanum \mylink{Charm}{secrets-charm} is Splittable and allows you to "...ensorcel one or more Monsters whose \HD are less than or equal to \DICE". If you had a pool of 4 Blood Dice, you could use 3 dice on 1 Monster and 2 on another, 1 die on 4 Monsters, etc. with the additional requirement that the \DICE used on the Monster is equal to or greater than their \HD

A marble-sized bead of shit lands at a Nearby or Far-Away point you select. You can cause the sphere to detonate at any time in \DICE Hours (including immediately). All creatures Close or Nearby the sphere's detonation must

\DICE-1 purple and gold tents appear in a circle around the campfire where you and your Band are taking a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}. Each tent includes a bedroll, a sleeping platform, a cot, a candle, and a pair of warm slippers. 
A cookpot appears over the fire with a stew going, enough to provide Provisions for you and your Band, regardless of how many \DICE you spent. Any items removed from the tents instantly vanish. In the radius of the campfire the temperature is moderated very slightly, wind and rain are lessened, and vermin won't enter.  The tents are immune to casual attack, including from wandering Monsters (anyone sleeping outside the tents might not be so lucky). When the campfire goes out or the sun rises, the Glamping Charm disappears. The campsite can be utterly dispelled by Morass if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

You roll a small orb of Entropy to a point Nearby or Far-Away; the orb rolls silently and is hard to see.  At any time for the next \SUMDICE Hours, you can have the orb detonate with an incredibly loud clattering, wailing, and whistling. It is audible in clear air up to a \DICE km away. You can designate \DICE conditions under which the orb will detonate. For example, you could say "now"; "if anyone steps on it"; or "if water touches it".  The conditions must be obvious and must occur within 1m of the orb. Creatures Close to the detonation must Save or gain \effect{Concussed} for the \Duration.

You emit \DICE sprays of color from your fingertips that you can split among \DICE Monsters.  For each Monster, if the \SUMDICE of the \DICE targeting the Monster is twice as much (equal to or greater) as the Monster's \HD, it
is \effect{Befuddled} for the \Duration.  If \SUMDICE is three times the Monster's \HD, it is \effect{Stunned} for a Moment, then \effect{Befuddled} as above.

You can summon a Bashing, Chopping, or Stabbing weapon of Force.  You can change the type of weapon by using 1 Action in Combat.  The weapon does \DICE damage and can hit creatures only affected by magic.  Only you can fight with the Ego Weapon.   You must make a successful Attack using your \INT (instead of \VIG or \DEX) to hit with the weapon.  A \mylink{Helping Hand}{secrets-helping-hand} can wield an Ego Weapon, but you can only have 1 Ego Weapon in existence at a time.  The weapon lasts for the entire Session.

On creatures that do not possess Blood or \mypg{Spell Dice}{monster-spell-dice}, this Secret has no effect.  Otherwise, the target of the Secret immediately takes \DICE damage for each unspent Blood/Spell Die they possess.

If 3 or more Blood Dice are spent on this Secret, the target must also immediately Save. Failure means they must immediately try \mybold{all} unspent Blood or Spell Dice as if they were manifesting them (any rolls of a 1 or a 2 loses the die; if you roll triples a Mishap occurs; etc.), though no magic will manifest.

You summon a bank of swirling and shifting fog that exists for as long as you Concentrate.  The fog can move with you, or you can take 2 Actions to mentally direct it somewhere Nearby.  The fog will blanket \SUMDICE creatures or a space \DICE+\DICE meters cubed.  Missiles that are thrown or shot into the fog strike a random target; nothing can be thrown or shot out of the fog.

You project \DICE will-o'the-wisps into an area Close or Nearby.  The wisps can move one range (Close to Nearby, Nearby to Far Away, etc) in 1 Action.  You can split the wisps up any way you like but they can't be more than Far-Away from you.  The wisps do not shed heat, do not require air, and can't be doused by water.  They shed a steady yellow light the brightness of a torch.  At the top of the Moment, you can command up to \DICE wisps to \effect{Befuddle} up to \DICE Monsters that are Close to them.   Monsters get an initial Save and, if they succeed, the wisp targeting them is dispelled; otherwise, the Befuddlement lasts as long as you Concentrate. If any of the wisps are struck by an Enervate spell, they are all dispelled if a Wizard Fight! is lost.  When a wisp is dispelled, any Monsters \effect{Befuddled} by the wisp are released from the effect.

Toss a small ball of grease at a point on the ground Close or Nearby. If you would prefer to throw the ball at a person or object, make an Attack \RO using your \INT - if you miss, it dissipates.  If thrown at the ground, the surface becomes slick with a thick oil; anyone attempting to move through the area must \ROTRY{\DEX \PLUS \MD} with a -\DICE penalty, or immediately gain \effect{Prone}.  It requires a successful \RO as above to get up again.  

If you throw the Greaseball at a Monster, the effect is as above -  plus they can't hold anything without dropping it.  If you throw it at an object, the object becomes impossible to carry or hold until the grease is removed with an \mylink{Acid}{malignants-acids} (any strength), or is burned off.

Forks of lightning erupt from your outstretched hands, striking a Close or Nearby target for \SUMDICE damage (Save for half). You can cause the
lightning to "jump" up to \DICE-1 times to another creature or object Close by, provided they are conductive (iron armor, metal ladders, etc).  Magic
swords aren't conductive.  You can "ping-pong" between two objects if you desire. Creatures struck by any bolt after the first take \DICE damage

The mule walks at a brisk trot.  It will stop and turn at your verbal command, but you cannot make it reverse or slow down. You can only give it the commands "go", "stop", "left", and "right". If the mule takes any damage, it immediately disappears and drops all the items on the ground.  The mule will obey your last command until the spell's duration expires.  Hammerspace Mules think that Illusions are real; if the Illusion would damage them in some way (a pit they would fall into, a spear they would run into, etc) the Mule is dispelled (dropping its items on the ground) if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

For example, you could leap from the ground to top of a steeple, or you could leap over the steeple to land on the ground, but you couldn't leap from the top of a steeple to the ground.  When you land, you can make a \RSTRY{\DEX} (\RSTRY{\INT} if you are the caster) and if you succeed, you can leap again. You can do this up to \DICE times.

When you resist the final Secret, the enchantment immediately ends. If the Secret ends while items are stored in your head, they will mix with your brain-matter. Usually this is fatal, though some Philosophers pack their head with \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} and have a buddy speak a \mylink{Charm}{secrets-charm} Secret to them.

You create an illusion of anything you desire. If anything touches the illusion, it will pass through it with no effect.  Think of the illusion as a perfectly accurate hologram that you are creating - the illusion can be
heard in addition to being seen, can perform the same action over and over again, and can deliver messages, but it can't interact in a meaningful way
or perform complex actions based on external forces. Each aspect of the illusion requires one or more Blood die to cast:

\callout{\footnotesize{

  \item Having the illusion speak or make noise requires 1 \DICE for each word or sound (wailing, shouting, etc);
  \item Having the illusion appear to be a physical thing a (hole in the ground, a stone wall, orc guard, etc.) requires 1 \DICE for each square meter in size; 
  \item Having the illusion appear to move requires 1 \DICE for every meter;
  \item Having the illusion appear on a living creature (disguising them as a beggar or a lamp post) requires 1 \DICE, and they cannot be wearing or carrying any iron.
}}}

Note that there is some Arbiter's discretion here.  A guard pacing in front of a door might require 4 \DICE (a 2m tall "thing" pacing back and forth 2 meters), but more if you want them to appear more "natural" and not like a robot marching back and forth.  A disguise placed on someone to appear to be a beggar might cost 1 \DICE, but disguising yourself as the king will be significantly harder.

The Illusion will last for \DICE real-world hours.  Anyone touching the illusion will immediately know it to be fake, but this doesn't cause the illusion to disappear.  However, if the illusion is touched with an Ego Weapon, it will disappear if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

You draw a circle in the air of \DICE+\DICE diameter, in any orientation. The inside of the circle is made of Force, as solid as stone. You can cause the circle to raise, lower, or hover in place.  You can only move up and down (never side-to-side).  Up to \DICE people could stand under it and be completely covered, or on it and be levitated provided they don't weigh more than \DICE x200kg.  If you lower the circle on top of someone, they take \DICE damage
per Moment. The circle moves 10 meters a minute (about 3m per Moment).  You can change the disc's orientation at any time.  If the Levitating Disc is targeted with Suspend Objects, the disc will be dispelled if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

Up to \DICE non-living thing slam shut and can't be opened for the \Duration. If the object is a door, chest, or something like it, it will slam shut forcefully and loudly. This Secret can work on things that aren't portals (a sword could be locked in its scabbard). You can also use this Secret to lock a specific memory or thought, making it immune to mind reading or scrying without a \RBTRY{\INT}{\INT}.  The Lock can be dispelled by the Secret: Knock if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

You summon a giant slab of meat that fills an area \DICE meters cubed.  The meat weighs \DICE x100kg and lasts for \DICE real-world hours. \mypg{Zoological Monsters}{monster-trait-zoological} will attack the Meat Shield first. When the Meat Shield has been dealt \SUMDICE+\DICE damage or more to the Meat, consider it consumed/destroyed. During a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}, up to \DICE Allies can eat the Meat Shield in lieu of rolling their Provisions, but the provenance of the meat is ... unknown.  If a Scything Disc of Nog is used on a Meat Shield, the shield will be dispelled if a Wizard Fight! is lost (otherwise, it will take damage as normal).

Your next inhalation allows you inhale 10x the normal amount of air. Not only does this allow you to hold your breath for 10x as long, but if you
exhale forcefully it will release a blast of air strong enough to knock pigeons out of air and polish your teeth. A human-sized creature gains \effect{Prone} and is pushed Nearby unless they try a \RBTRY{\DEX}{\INT} or \RBTRY{\VIG}{\INT} (their choice) with a -\DICE penalty.  This Secret will also blow open all closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all windows in a building, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack.

You create \DICE illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay Close to you. They are constantly stepping through each other,
making it impossible to determine which representation of you is "real". When an enemy attacks you, they'll always hit an image first.  An image vanishes as soon as it suffers
a solid impact (a blow from a mace, but also a slap). Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to instantly vanish (and you take the
damage, naturally). Finally, (re)invoking Mirror Image causes any other images that already exist to immediately vanish.

The ground \SUMDICE meters in radius and \DICE meters deep turns to black muck.  Monsters and objects in the mud sink 1 meter per Moment.  At the top of
the Moment, a creature can \RB: \VIG with a -\DICE penalty vs. your \INT to pull themselves out 1 meter (if they were only 1 meter deep to begin with, they escape).  If someone's head dips below the mud (2m for people, 1m for Pooka, 4m or more for giants), they immediately being drowning and must make a \DEATH roll at the top of every Moment they are submerged (they can still claw their way up 1m with a successful \RB try, as above).  If they don't have a \DEATH, they die in \HD Moments.

The Secret lasts for as long as you \mylink{Concentrate}{time-concentration}.  When you break your Concentration, everything that sunk in the mud is immediately vomited back to the surface. If the area covered by the Morass is targeted by Bastogne's Glamping Charm, the Morass will be dispelled (and the objects brought to the surface) if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

You roll a small orb of Mind to a point Close, Nearby or Far-Away; the orb rolls silently and is hard to see.  When the orb stops rolling it immediately and silently detonates.  Creatures Close to the designated point are inflicted with \effect{Deafened} until they move somewhere Nearby; likewise, no sound can be made (including speaking) while Close to the point of detonation. Arcana and skills that require vocalization are impossible within this area of silence, which lasts as long as you \mylink{Concentrate}{time-concentration}.  The bomb can be dispelled by Cacophony if a Wizard Fight! is lost.

A brilliant white light emanates from your forehead to a point Nearby or Far-Away, where it splits into a prism of \DICE beams.  Each beam strikes a
random Monster Close to the prism (roll for each beam; a Monster can be hit by more than 1 beam).  Roll a d8 on the table below for each beam and apply its results.

You can breathe out up to \DICE elements (fire, acid, water, wind, steam, etc) immediately in front of you for a Moment.  The elements don't interact with one another and act independently, so if you were to belch out fire and water, you would get the effects of both.  If the order matters (set something on fire and immediately douse it with water), you pick the order of effects.  Water breath is enough to extinguish fires smaller than a big bonfire, or wash off acid; wind breath could push a small sailboat or blow swarming insects out of an area; acid breath bleaches the color from objects and irritates the eyes; fire breath would cause paper and flammable objects (but not people, unless they were doused in oil) to catch fire, etc.

Reduce all damage of a single chosen element (acid, cold, fire, lightning, etc) by -\DICE per die (minimum of 1).

You send an invisible wedge of Force along the ground in a straight line up to a Distant point. The wedge can take up to \DICE left or right turns at your command. Any light debris in the path (snow, small stones, leaves, grass) is pushed to the side; fields can be tilled. Any pressure plates or tripwires are activated. You do not have to be able to see the entire path, but you do need to know the approximate route the wedge will take. The wedge can't move through solid objects, and it can't directly hurt anyone (though it will push them to the side). The path cleared is \DICE meters wide.

You become encased in elaborate plate mail that seems to be made from constantly congealing blood.  You definitely stand out in a crowd. Your \MD drops to d8.  The \UD for the Armor depends on the number of \DICE invested: 1 d4; 2 d8; 3+ d12. You can only have one Sanguine Mail active at a time.

Your clothes and hair animate to carry you around. You can move at full speed in any orientation, and you can freely rotate as you move. For
instance, you could run while standing on your head, holding a torch, and turning counterclockwise. You can lie on your side and, while flipping end

You summon a cloud of somnolent dust to a point Close or Nearby. \SUMDICE creatures Close to the cloud, who have no more than \DICE \mypg{Hit Dice}{monster-hit-dice}, must

You don't have control over who falls asleep, it's entirely random - but will be as many creatures as possible (up to \SUMDICE), which means lower \HD creatures will go to sleep first.

\SUMDICE dribbling candles appear on objects you touch. You can walk around placing candles as required for Minutes. The candles are lit and burn for
