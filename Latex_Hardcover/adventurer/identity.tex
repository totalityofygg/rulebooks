    Assign a d8 to each facet of your Identity. This die may be increased depending on your \mypg{Trope}{adventurer-tropes}
}

\begin{multicols*}{2}\raggedcolumns

Identity represents your Adventurer's natural, "god given" talents. Your Identity is broken into four characteristics:

\mybullet {
    \item \hl{Vigor} \VIG
    \item \hl{Dexterity} \DEX
    \item \hl{Intelligence} \INT
    \item \hl{Focus} \FOC 
}



\callout {
The d6 and d10 represent the lowest and highest characteristics of a "normal" person; that is to say, values higher than a d10 or lower than a d6 will only occur through beneficial magics or terrible catastrophes. Someone possessing a Girdle of Giant Strength may have a \VIG of d12, while someone affected with a wasting disease may have a \VIG of d4.
}
