\myhighlight{Guildmaster}{adv-knave-virtue-guildmaster} 

You become the grandmaster of a new Thieves Guild. Choose a Medium or Large Settlement where your guild is located. When you take Downtime in this Settlement, you will be given information, food, and lodging for free. When figuring out how much coin you must pay for resting, treat the length of your stay as if it were one step less expensive i.e. treat Months as if you were staying for Weeks; Weeks for Days; and Days cost you nothing (staying for Years still costs the same, however). The Arbiter must share a rumor with you about your current or next adventure - the clue might be obscure, but it must be true.

If you desire, 2 footpads will join you on your next adventure.  They are \mypg{Mercenaries}{gear-mercenaries} in all ways like \mybold{Mechanics}, except they have a starting Loyalty of 9, wear Leather Armor, and have no trouble working together. In Combat, you have to specify what each footpad is doing at the top of each Moment i.e. "1 is giving me +1 damage and I'm keeping one back to take damage in case things go south." Outside of Combat, each footpad can provide you with a +1 on any Whisper tries. If a footpad dies or leaves your service, you can replace them with another during the Production Step of Downtime. Note that if your footpads often meet with an untimely end, starve to death, leave your service, etc. you may begin to develop a ... reputation ... at the Arbiter's discretion.

You are encouraged to work out additional details with the Arbiter, and let the Arbiter know the name of your guild.
