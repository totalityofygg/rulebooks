  \callout {
    You can perform Charms at will. Casting a Charm takes Moments; in Combat, invoking a Charm is a Combat Maneuver. You need neither hands nor speech to invoke a Charm, but you must be conscious.

  \mysubsection{Aphrodite's Sigh}{charm-aphrodites-sigh}

  By means of this Charm you can create a ghostly moaning sound that appears to come from somewhere Nearby. The moan is not loud nor can it quite cause fear, but any that hear it will know of its "unnatural" nature. 

  \mysubsection{Candlelight}{charm-candlelight}

  This Charm creates a small mote of light roughly equal to a candle's light that hovers near your head. The Charm is typically used for reading or lighting a small area (half a cubic meter). This charm cannot be cast into someone's eyes. The light is dim enough that it's not particularly useful for lighting dark passages unless that passage is very well known (such as your own home). 

  \mysubsection{Creature Comforts}{charm-creature-comforts}

  You can raise or lower the temperature of any non-living material a few degrees, enough to warm or cool food or drinks or a room.  The temperature cannot be raised to a degree where it would injure anyone.


  \mysubsection{Dowsing}{charm-dowsing}

  Using a forked wand of hazelwood, you can sense the direction of a substantial body of potable water.  It ignores "insignificant" amounts of water, as found in a waterskin or barrel.  The Charm doesn't tell you how hard it might be to get to the water.

  \mysubsection{Fastening}{charm-fastening}

  This Charm allows you to close one door or window that is not locked or otherwise barred. This will not lock the door or window unless by the action of closing it naturally becomes locked. 

  \mysubsection{Flame of Vesta}{charm-flame-of-vesta}

  You may change a fire into one of black flame, so that it casts no light but still provides heat.  You can affect a normal fire up to the size of a campfire.

  \mysubsection{Jinx}{charm-jinx}

  You can perform a minor hex by tracing a five pointed star in the air with your forefinger. The hex can affect something Nearby or closer.  These hexes can be severing a rope, shattering a pane of glass, spoiling a piece of food, or some other small act of malice.  Note that these hexes will not work if there is a Pooka nearby

  \mysubsection{Levitate}{charm-levitate}

  You may use this Charm to lift an object via magic alone. The object needs to be non-living and weigh less than 1kg. The object will remain floating in mid-air for up to 1 Hour as long as you are paying at least some attention to it. If you are distracted at all, say in Combat or casting another spell (including another Charm) then the object drops. 

  \mysubsection{Matchstick}{charm-matchstick}

  When you drag your forefinger along a rough surface, your fingertip combusts like a giant phosphorus match. It burns for a Moment (long enough to light a pipe or \mylink{Smoke}{gear-narcotics}) and does not hurt you in any way.

  \mysubsection{Message}{charm-message}

  You can send a brief message, no more than a dozen words, to a person you know. This person can be any distance away, but they have to be able to understand the language of the message you're sending.

  \mysubsection{Puff of Air}{charm-puff-of-air}

  This Charm creates a small puff of air; enough to blow away dust from objects or to put out a candle, but not enough to put out a torch or lantern. The puff can move very light items as would a puff of air blown from natural means. This charm can be used to blow dirt from an item or area 1m by 1m. 

  \mysubsection{Spice}{charm-spice}

  This Charm flavors one serving of food. The flavor can be changed but it does not change the nature of the food item nor does make poisoned food or spoiled food edible. The flavor can be chosen by you. 

  \mysubsection{Sweet Dreams}{charm-sweet-dreams}

  This Charm allows you to make a willing creature fall asleep. The Charm won't work if used against an unwilling subject. You can cast this Charm on yourself, but this will be the last thing you do that day.

  If used on a subject who is already asleep, you can breathe in their ear and control what dreams they have the following night. No matter how unpleasant the dreams, this cannot prevent the victim from getting a full nightâ€™s rest on its own, but it can affect their mood.

  \mysubsection{Third Eye}{charm-third-eye}

  By holding or touching an inanimate object and concentrating for Minutes, you can detect whether or not something is magical in nature, or if something can "hold" an enchantment (including staves, swords, and holy relics). Additionally, if something or someone is marked by a \mylink{Witch Mark}{occultism-witch-mark}, the Third Eye permits you to see it.

  \mysubsection{Tidy}{charm-tidy}

  This Charm can be used to clean a single object. The object can be anything: clothing, armor, weapons or even a area of a home. Unlike other Charms this one can be cast on a willing living participant. Casting Tidy on yourself will make you appear as if you had recently bathed and donned fresh clothing. This Charm can clean 1 cubic meter of space or an area 3m x 3m. 

  Alternately, you can fix minor wear and tear in non-living and non-metal apparel as if you were using a needle and thread.  The amount of material mended cannot exceed 1 cubic meter.  You cannot fix a dented piece of armor or sharpen a sword, but you could fix a pane of glass if all the pieces are present, or reattach a broken strap of a backpack

  Finally, you can use this Charm to "freshen" one object up to 1 cubic meter. Typical uses are removing the wrinkles in a garment; brightening the color of some non-living object; making bland food more favorable; or polishing metal or glass. All these effects are considered to be a minor illusion. This Charm can't make poisoned or spoiled food edible. 

  \mysubsection{Turkish Delight}{charm-turkish-delight}

  You can create a single piece of food or drink, such as a Turkish delight, a piece of fruit, or glass of wine. It is exquisitely delicious and provides no nourishment whatsoever. If not eaten within Minutes, it dissolves into black smoke.  You can apply a Toxin to this food if you have one.

  \mysubsection{Unbolting}{charm-unbolting}

  This Charm allows you to open one door, window, chest or other item that is not locked or otherwise barred. 

  \mysubsection{Watchdog}{charm-watchdog}

  You can place an area of alarm around yourself.  Any creature larger than a cat that comes Close or Nearby to you sets off a mental alarm that will wake you up from non-magical sleep.  You will not know what has entered the circle, but you will know something has, and the general direction.
