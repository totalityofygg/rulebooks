\mysection{Armor}{gear-armor}

When you're out of Grit, attacks starting hitting your Armor (see \mylink{Guarding}{combat-guarding} under \mylink{Combat}{combat}). Roll your Armor's \UD and absorb that much damage from the blow. When you roll a Failure the first time, move your Current (not \MAX) value \DCDOWN; every hit after that, move \mybold{both} the Current and \MAX values down as your armor becomes more and more damaged - rent mail, dented plate, etc.

When the \MAX value of your armor drops, you must hire a professional (smith, leatherworker, ironmonger, etc) to repair it. See the \mylink{Shopping Step}{downtime-shopping} under \mylink{Downtime}{downtime} for information on how to hire these tradesfolk.

Finally, the Armor you wear indicates your \MD, as well as what die to try if you roll a \mylink{Fumble}{combat-crits-and-fumbles}.
