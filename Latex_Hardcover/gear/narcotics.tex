Narcotics (which includes alcohol) are plentiful on the Five Dwarfs, and almost always entirely legal. Each Narcotic has a \MAX value associated with it, indicating the maximum number of times you can use it "safely" each Session.

If you use a Narcotic the \MAX number of times in a given Session, you must check for Addiction.  Make an \RSTRY{\FOC} - if you fail, you're Addicted (see below). Note that there are some Narcotics with a \MAX of 1, which means you should immediately check to see if you're Addicted.

If you use a Narcotic \mybold{more} than the \MAX number of times in a given session, you must check to see if you Overdose in addition to the Addiction try (see below).


\myhighlight{Addiction}{gear-narcotics-addiction}

If you become Addicted, you must "get a hit" of the Narcotic at least once at the start of every Session.  Additionally, during any \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}, you must buy a full \UD of the Narcotic (but don't add it to your inventory, you'll use it immediately).  Additional \UD of narcotics can be purchased on top of these before you go back out into the wilds, of course.

If you are unable to get your fix, you are \effect{Sickened} until you get the drug again (\mybold{Pharmaceuticals} under \mypg{Arcana: Leechcraft}{arcana-leechcraft} can prevent this effect for the Session). The only way to cure Addiction is to take some Downtime and get some treatment (see the section on \mypg{Medicine}{vulgate-medicine}).

\myhighlight{Overdose}{gear-narcotics-overdose}

If you exceed the \MAX number of doses listed for the Narcotic, you may suffer an Overdose. Make an \RSTRY{\FOC}. If you roll a Failure, you are immediately afflicted with the negative effect described under the Narcotic; you do not gain its positive benefit. If you do not roll a Failure, you gain the positive benefit of the Narcotic. If you continue to press your luck by purposely Overdosing, move your \FOC die \DCDOWN (but only for the purposes of checking for Addiction and Overdose) each time you make your check. These penalties reset at the end of the Session.
