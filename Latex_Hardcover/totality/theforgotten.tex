\mysection{The Forgotten}{the-forgotten}



The unlucky souls who come into contact with \mybold{the Void} are removed from \mybold{the Dream}, removed from all thought and memory, a shadow of a shadow in a forgotten tomb. Souls imprisoned in Limbo await a different fate.

If a name is lost, if a soul is forgotten, they become \mypg{Obliterated}{forgotten-obliterated} - remembered only by the Unseelie \mypg{Spriggan}{species-spriggan} who live outside of the Dream. Forever will the Obliterated exist, beyond the confines of the Dream, spinning and swirling through their own Hell and unable to remember who they were or what they dreamed. Devils and demons, elementals and beasts are counted among their number, the tormentors and tyrants of forgotten Mortal souls.

Luckier(?) are the \mypg{Abandoned}{forgotten-abandoned}, the populace of Limbo who remember who they are and who they were. Fallen Small Gods, broken idols, dead spirits - they whisper their sorrows and regrets back into the Dream and hope that Mortals will hear their plaintive cries, remembering them again. The names of the lost exist only as a line in a book buried by the sands of the desert, or etched on forgotten stela in the wilderness, or inscribed on scrimshaw lost beneath the waves; they exist in psalms sung by the faithful, or scriptures read to congregations; in the spores of hallucinogenic mushrooms or smokes of deadly opiums; as a symbol on a prayer bead or painted on a cathedral ceiling. Should their name ever be erased and forgotten, they too will become Obliterated.

The Obliterated and the Abandoned are known as \mybold{the Forgotten}, beings who exist beyond Mortal recollection but live again through the Spriggan's \mypg{Remembrance}{remembrance}. The Forgotten owe allegiance to the King of Elfland, and they can be summoned by the King's subjects to do their bidding, and cast aside when their Unhallowed masters tire of them.
