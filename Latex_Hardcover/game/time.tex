\mysection{Time}{game-time}

\begin{center}

The amount of time that transpires for your Adventurer in the Totality of Ygg is abstract - things take "Minutes" to do, or you rest for "Hours", or your journey takes "Weeks".  There is also the concept of "real world" or "meta" time, which is covered in the section on \mypg{Meta Rules}{game-meta}.

\mybold{\myhighlight{Concentration}{time-concentration}}

Some \mypg{Arcana}{arcana} and other effects require you to maintain \mybold{Concentration}.  Concentration is broken when you become distracted. Distraction is at the Arbiter's discretion - taking damage, being affected by the environment or by a spell, getting knocked over, the target of your spell moving out of sight or out of range, etc.  You can walk slowly and still Concentrate, but you can't run.  You can whisper but not yell. You can end your Concentration at any time.


\mybold{\myhighlight{Combat}{time-combat}}

Combat is divided into \mybold{Moments}, and takes \mybold{Minutes} to complete. Each Moment, you can take 1 or 2 \mybold{Actions}. If you win \mypg{Init}{combat-init}, you can take an Action \mybold{before} the Monsters. If you don't win Init, you have to wait for the Monsters to take their turn. Whether you win Init or not, you always take an Action after the Monsters (unless prevented from doing so).

Some effects occur at the \mybold{Top of the Moment} or the \mybold{Bottom of the Moment}.  Effects that happen at the Top of the Moment occur immediately \myital{before} you take your first Action, but \myital{after} you've rolled Init.  Effects that happen at the Bottom of the Moment occur just before you start the next Moment, after everyone (including Monsters) has taken their turn.

Finally, certain effects and abilities have a duration of "Combat", meaning the effect or ability lasts until the end of Combat, \myital{before} you take a \mybold{Breather} (see below).

\mybold{\myhighlight{Resting}{time-resting}}

After Combat, you should take a \mybold{Breather} for a few Minutes to smoke a cigarette and pull yourself together.  Eventually you'll need to take a few Hours to eat, sleep, and get your strength back: this requires you to take a \mybold{Bivouac}. More details on Breathers and Bivouacs can be found in the section \mypg{Combat : When the Dust Settles}{combat-resting-bivouac}.

In order to spend your treasures and cure your insanities, you'll need Days or Weeks (or longer!) of respite. You'll need to take some \mybold{Downtime} in one of the towns and cities that dot the continents of the Five Dwarfs. More details on Downtime can be found in the section on \mypg{Settlements}{civilization-settlements}.
