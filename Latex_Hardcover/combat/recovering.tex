  \mysubsection{Taking a Breather (Minutes)}{combat-resting-breather}

  Combat takes Minutes to finish, no matter how many Moments actually occurred.  Once Combat is over, you can take a \mybold{Breather}.  Restore 4 Grit up to your \MAX (unless an \mylink{Injury}{adventurer-kismet-injury} prevents you from doing so) plus whatever \mylink{Narcotics}{gear-narcotics} or \mylink{Arcana}{arcana} might restore.  If you have the Sellsword Virtue \mypg{Second Skin}{sellsword-virtue-second-skin}, you can repair a \UD of Armor as well, up to its \MAX.

  You don't need to take a Breather in a safe place, but common sense should prevail - taking a quick nap in front of the goblin horde after you beheaded the chieftain isn't OK.  You can only take 1 Breather per Combat.


  \mysubsection{Taking a Bivouac (Hours)}{combat-resting-bivouac}

  If you need a longer rest, you can set up camp and take a Bivouac. When sleeping rough in this way, there is the risk of \mylink{Wandering Monsters}{arbiter-monsters-wandering} finding you unless you take precautions. Each time you make a Bivouac, make a \UD roll of your \mylink{Personal Provisions}{gear-equipment} (you can share Personal Provisions with others, but you have to roll for each person).  If you don't have enough Personal Provisions, you can't get any of the good effects. 

  \mybold{If an \mylink{Injury}{adventurer-kismet-injury} doesn't prevent you from doing so:}

\callout {

  \mybullet {
    \item Restore 1 Flesh. 
    \item Set your Grit to \MAX. If your Grit was higher than \MAX, the beneficial effect ends.
    \item Restore 1 \UD of your \mylink{Armor}{gear-armor}, up to its \MAX.
    \item Restore 1 \UD of \myital{one} aspect of your \mylink{Personality}{adventurer-personality}, up to its \MAX.
  }
}

  \cbreak\bump

  \mybold{Additionally, where applicable:}

\callout {

  \mybullet {
    \item Restore \DCUP of your \mylink{Prowess}{sellsword-prowess}.
    \item Restore \DCUP of your Lucky Die (\mylink{Knave}{knave-lucky-die} or \mylink{Pooka}{pooka-lucky-die}).
    \item Restore \DCUP of your \mylink{Juju}{cruces-mojo-juju}.
    \item Restore \DCUP of your \mylink{Ingenuity}{cruces-knowledge-ingenuity}.
    \item Restore 2 \mylink{Blood Dice}{cruces-blood-dice}.
    \item Restore your \mylink{Grace Die}{vulgate-sacraments-grace}.
    \item Restore 1 \mylink{Sovereignty}{remembrance}.

  }

}


Note that "up to \MAX" is implied in all of the above.


\mysubsection{Taking Downtime}{combat-resting-downtime}

You may need to take Days, Weeks, or Months to repair the damage done to yourself (as well as spend your treasures!).  See the \mylink{Downtime}{downtime} section under \mylink{Settlements}{civilization-settlements} for more info on resting for Days, Weeks, or Months.
