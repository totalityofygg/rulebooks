  \mysubsection{Prowess}{sellsword-prowess}

  Your Prowess is a Resource Die whose result can be added to \mybold{any} \mylink{Combat Action}{combat-combat-actions} or \mylink{Guarding Action}{combat-guarding} try. If you apply the result of a Prowess try to a Combat Action, you also add the result to your damage (this damage is applied \mybold{after} \mylink{Lethal damage}{combat-damage-lethal}, if applicable). You can roll your Prowess \myital{after} your try is rolled (it doesn't have to be at the same time), but you can only roll it once per Moment. 

Your Prowess starts at \UDD{d4}, and moves \DCDOWN on a Failure.




  \myhighlight{Mortal}{sellsword-mortal}
    
  You are creature of Order, and possess a soul - and are thus \mybold{Hallowed}.

    \myhighlight{Veteran}{sellsword-virtue-veteran}

    \mysubsection{Sellsword Complications}{sellsword-complications}

    \end{center}


    \myhighlight{Alcoholic}{sellsword-complication-alcoholic}

    You are addicted to \mylink{Alcohol}{gear-narcotics-alcohol}. Whenever you take a \mylink{Breather}{combat-resting-breather}, you have to take at least one drink or you heal no Grit; whenever you take a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}, you must take at least one drink or gain none of the beneficial effects of resting. \RSTRY{\VIG} at the end of the Bivouac - if you fail, you are inflicted with \effect{Hung Over}.

\newpage

    \myhighlight{Cheap Tricks}{sellsword-complication-cheap-tricks}

    You do not like or trust magic or the unnatural. Your dislike extends to \mylink{Philosophers}{trope-philosopher} and \mylink{The Unseelie}{the-inhabitants}. The degree to which you feel this way is up to you. Let the Arbiter know why.

    \myhighlight{The Cimmerian}{sellsword-complication-cimmerian}

    Your appearance is so outlandish, barbaric, out-sized, etc. that even educated and well-traveled people will stop to stare at you. People can pick you easily out of a crowd, and your reputation precedes you.

    \myhighlight{Credo}{sellsword-complication-credo}
  
    You must make a vow - a short, specific, personal statement that you will not forget. For example, "I will protect my friend Johann" or "I will never harm an unarmed person". You must follow this vow to the best of your ability.

    \myhighlight{Filthy}{sellsword-complication-filthy}

    You refuse to bathe except under the most dire circumstances. Your general hygiene is horrible. If you're using \mypg{Persuasion}{arbiter-persuasion}, you can never seduce someone (intimidate is a different story), and if you're downwind from \mylink{Monsters}{monsters} it might affect your ability to get the Drop on them.

    \myhighlight{Hippophobia}{sellsword-complication-hippophobia}

    You are afraid of horses and mules. You refuse to ride one (riding in a cart is OK).


    \myhighlight{Honorable}{sellsword-complication-honorable}

    You refuse payment for good deeds, always rescue the helpless, and refuse to fight unarmed foes (within reason, of course). 

    \myhighlight{Mortal Enemy}{sellsword-complication-mortal-enemy}

    You have a mortal enemy, someone powerful who has done you significant wrong. This enemy should be substantially more powerful than you. You are driven by your revenge against this mortal enemy. Tell the Arbiter who they are, and why they are your enemy.

    \myhighlight{Pit Fighter}{sellsword-complication-pit-fighter}

    You strongly believe that combat should take place between two people face-to-face. You won't use Shoot weapons, and you'll never throw a Throw weapon at a target.

    \myhighlight{Sins of the Father}{sellsword-complication-sins-father}

    Your parent (alive or dead) is infamous. If people ever discover that you are their child, they will have significant negative reactions. At the Arbiter's complete discretion you will encounter various assassins, sellswords, and kidnappers who have figured out who you are, and want to do you harm. Tell the Arbiter a bit about this parent.

 
  \mysubsection{Sellsword Starting Gear}{sellsword-starting-gear}

    In addition to any gear you might have gained from Virtues, you have:

\callout{\footnotesize{
  \mybullet {

    \item a worn bedroll;
    \item a backpack;
    \item \UDD{d4} of \mylink{Personal Provisions}{gear-equipment};
    \item one pitted \mylink{Shield}{gear-armor} OR one rusty \mylink{Helmet}{gear-armor} OR one \mylink{Spear}{gear-vig-weapons};
    \item one pick OR 3 rolls on the \mylink{Random Items}{appendix-a-random-items} table in Appendix A
  }}}


    \myhighlight{What Next?}{sellsword-what-next}

    The Sellsword is built for \mypg{Combat}{combat}; the section on \mypg{Fighting}{combat-fighting}, including \mypg{Maneuver Actions}{combat-maneuvers}, and \mypg{Combat Actions}{combat-combat-actions} should be the next thing you check out.
