   \myhighlight{Discordian}{philosopher-virtue-discordian}

   You may \mylink{Ride the Tiger}{cruces-blood-ride-the-tiger} in lieu of rolling Blood Dice at any time. You may channel up to 2 Blood Dice (instead of 1) in this way. Once per Session, you may ignore the effects of any rolls on the \mylink{Mishap Table}{table-mishap}. See the section on the \mypg{Crux of Blood}{cruces-blood}.

    \myhighlight{Scribe}{philosopher-virtue-scribe}

      You can transcribe \mylink{Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets} from Fetishes to Grimoires (and vice versa), ink magical tattoos, and write glyphs and symbols.

        \item Choose 1 of the \mybold{Secrets} of \mybold{Arcana: Wizardry}; this Secret is etched on the inside of your skull. If someone cuts off your head and scoops out your brains, they can use your skull as if it were a \mylink{Fetish}{fetishes}. You do not need to read this Secret from a Grimoire or a Fetish - it is a part of you - though you must have a tongue and use of your hands to perform the Secret. See the section on \mypg{Arcana: Wizardry}{arcana-wizardry} for more info.

    }

\cbreak

\mysubsection{Philosopher Complications}{philosopher-complications}


    \begin{center}
        \myemph{Choose 1 of the following}
    \end{center}


  \myhighlight{Bibliophile}{philosopher-complication-bibliophile}          

  You really, really love books. If given the choice between a share of treasure and a book you haven't read, you will opt for the book every time. You will look to build a library and hire porters to carry spare books around for you. The books you covet must be unusual or educational (practically, this means Grimoires or books that teach or augment Skills). You must have at least 2 \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} worth of books with you at all times. Tell the Arbiter about your favorite book.

  \myhighlight{It is I - Balthazar the Breathtaking!}{philosopher-complication-arrogance}

  There's your typical run-of-the-mill arrogance - braggarts, blowhards, and boasters - and then there's you. Your arrogance is on a whole other level. You won't tolerate any other Philosophers in your Band. You accept no masters and believe in no law but your own. To "the Man", you are an appalling spectacle, and should be put in your place (or in the ground) before you harm anyone else.

  \myhighlight{Logical}{philosopher-complication-logical}

  You are devoid of any emotion. People call you cold, distant, or calculating. When faced with a decision or dilemma, you will always opt for the logical, unemotional solution.

  \myimage{tropes/Philosopher_2}

  \myhighlight{Morbid}{philosopher-complication-morbid}

  You require corpses - the fresher, the better - to perform \mypg{Research}{research}. You'll need at least 1 fresh corpse if you want to use any Research Pips during \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}.

  \myhighlight{Mysophobia}{philosopher-complication-mysophobia}

  You have a fear of "contamination". You wear a mask and gloves that you rarely take off, insist on cleanliness whenever possible, keep your clothing and gear in neat order, and bathe often. Tell the Arbiter how you got this way.

\cbreak

  \myhighlight{Necronomicon}{philosopher-complication-necronomicon}

  You are in possession of a forbidden tome, text, or fetish. It's taught you everything you need to know and (quite possibly) made you slightly insane. All of your Research has to start with this book; practically, you have to make an \mypg{Insanity try}{adventurer-kismet-insanity} whenever you spend any Research Pips. Tell the Arbiter what this book is, and how you got it.

  \myhighlight{One More Page}{philosopher-complication-one-more-page}

  During a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}, you can't seem to stop reading, writing, drawing, or hypothesizing. You must make a \RSTRY{\FOC} when you take a \mypg{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}, in addition to your Provision roll. If you Fail (roll a 1 or a 2), you don't get any of the benefits of having rested.

 \myhighlight{Out of Shape}{philosopher-complication-out-of-shape}

  You're a little (OK, a lot) out of shape. One of your slots for \mylink{Burden}{gear-burden} is taken up by your excess weight, and you aren't able to run for longer than Minutes.


  \myhighlight{Transcendental Research}{philosopher-complication-transcendental-research}

  You require Narcotics to do Research. Pick a \mylink{Narcotic}{gear-narcotics}; you must roll a \UD of this Narcotic any time you spend Research Pips during  \mylink{Downtime}{downtime}.

  \myhighlight{Whoops!}{philosopher-complication-whoops}

  An experiment or spell went awry some time in your past. Roll twice on the \mylink{Mishaps table}{table-mishap}.

\newpage

  \mysubsection{Starting Gear}{philosopher-starting-gear}

    In addition to any gear you might have gained from Virtues, you have:

    \callout{\footnotesize{
    \mybullet {
      \item 1 silver piece; 
      \item a worn bedroll; 
      \item a book hanger;
      \item \UDD{d4} of \mylink{Personal Provisions}{gear-equipment};
      \item a \mylink{Sling}{gear-dex-weapons} or a \mylink{Quarterstaff}{gear-dex-weapons};
      \item one pick OR 3 rolls on the \mylink{Random Items}{appendix-a-random-items} table in Appendix A
    }}}



    \myhighlight{What Next?}{philosopher-what-next}

    If you're playing a sorcerer / magic-user type of Adventurer, you'll need to understand the \mypg{Crux of Blood}{cruces-blood} and your Blood \POOL. Then read up on \mypg{Arcana: Wizardry}{arcana-wizardry}. If you're the type of wizard who will carry \mypg{Secrets}{arcana-wizardry-secrets} around in a Grimoire, or create Fetishes and scrolls, read up on \mypg{Research: Inscription}{research-inscription} (and obviously take the Research Virtue during the creation of your Adventurer!).

\cbreak

\myimage{tropes/Philosopher_3}

    If you're playing a doctor / healer / mad-scientist type of Adventurer, you'll need to understand the \mypg{Crux of Knowledge}{cruces-knowledge} and how \mylink{Ingenuity}{cruces-knowledge-ingenuity} works. Then read up on \mypg{Arcana: Leechcraft}{arcana-leechcraft} and \mypg{Research: Inscription}{research-inscription}. If you'd like to heal more permanent injuries your Band might accrue, read a bit about \mylink{Vulgate of Medicine}{vulgate-medicine}; if you think of yourself more as an alchemist, check out \mypg{Research: Chymistry}{research-chymistry} (and obviously take the Research Virtue during the creation of your Adventurer!).
