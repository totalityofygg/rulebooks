During high level character creation, it became apparent that the "pick a single Virtue" became confusing with things like Kismet (which you could pick once every rank).  In order to make this clearer, Kismet, Personality, and Saves were broken into Kismet I-III, Personality I-III, and Saves I-III. Additionally, the Spriggan Virtue "Strange Medium" had to be broken into "Strange Medium", "Uncanny Medium", and "Extraordinary Medium" to fit the paradigm.

Added the following to "Mummy's Curse" (Knave):  "Finally, if the item remains unsold before you take Downtime at a Settlement, you must sell it during the Shopping Step or the curse immediately takes effect (though you still get a Save)."

During editing, it looks like 4 Weird Virtues for Night Children were left on the cutting room floor:  Rando, Run Away, Shedding, and Shocky. In addition, "Sleepy" had been renamed "Go Night Night" but hadn't been updated in the table.  These Virtues have been readded and "Sleepy" renamed to "Go Night Night".

For the Sellsword Virtue: Captain and the Knave Virtue: Guildmaster, clarified that these hirelings were Mercenaries and not Henchmen (specifically Meatshields and Mechanics, respectively). Fixed "Morale" to be "Loyalty", a later addition that didn't get added back to the description. Added in that Henchmen and Mercenaries expect to be fed(!) and clarified that killing them willy-nilly might get you a bad reputation. Nerfed Mercenaries to only give a +1 instead of a +2, but added that they can add the +1 to damage as well.

Cleaned up some ambiguity around Research and Cunning Pips:
- Changed the word "Time" to "Downtime" where appropriate i.e. from "takes Months of time" to "takes Months of Downtime"
- Added Downtime requirement to Chymistry;
- Clarified Inscription only requires Days of Downtime;
- Added reinforcing text that Marvels take Weeks to create;
- Added Days of Downtime to Miracles; 
- Added "[n]ote that any Cunning or Research Pips not spent at the end of the Production Step are lost." to the Production Step of Downtime

Added missing line "Finally, the Charmed Circle grants you 4 extra Cunning Pips to use as you wish." to Charmed Circle under Mystic Advancement.

- Under Spriggan, changed "Charms" to "Mortal Charms" and "Feyness" to "Wyrd" in Daredevil:Advancement to differentiate them from their Mortal equivalents.  Did the same thing with "Charms" for the Murks.
- Fixed "Unnatural Medium" to "Uncanny Medium" in the Advancement chart for Spriggan.
